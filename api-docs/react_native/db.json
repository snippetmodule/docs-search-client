So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, <code>state</code>, and <code>props</code>. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not.</p>\n<p>Let's do this thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hello-world\">\nHello World </h2>\n<p>In accordance with the ancient traditions of our people, we must first build an app that does nothing except say \"Hello world\". Here it is:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nclass HelloWorldApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Text&gt;Hello world!&lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorldApp', () =&gt; HelloWorldApp);</pre>\n<p>If you are feeling curious, you can play around with sample code directly in the web simulators. You can also paste it into your <code>index.ios.js</code> or <code>index.android.js</code> file to create a real app on your local machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-going-on-here\">\nWhat's going on here? </h2>\n<p>Some of the things in here might not look like JavaScript to you. Don't panic. This is the future.</p>\n<p>First of all, ES2015 (also known as ES6) is a set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the official standard, but not yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn't used yet in web development. React Native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility. <code>import</code>, <code>from</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>extends</code>, and the <code>() =&gt;</code> syntax in the example above are all ES2015 features. If you aren't familiar with ES2015, you can probably pick it up just by reading through sample code like this tutorial has. If you want, <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/\">this page</a> has a good overview of ES2015 features.</p>\n<p>The other unusual thing in this code example is <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello world!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>. This is JSX - a syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript. Many frameworks use a special templating language which lets you embed code inside markup language. In React, this is reversed. JSX lets you write your markup language inside code. It looks like HTML on the web, except instead of web things like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, you use React components. In this case, <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> is a built-in component that just displays some text.</p>\n<h2 id=\"component-and-appregistry\">\nComponent and AppRegistry </h2>\n<p>So this code is defining <code>HelloWorldApp</code>, a new <code>Component</code>, and it's registering it with the <code>AppRegistry</code>. When you're building a React Native app, you'll be making new components a lot. Anything you see on the screen is some sort of component. A component can be pretty simple - the only thing that's required is a <code>render</code> function which returns some JSX to render.</p>\n<p>The <code>AppRegistry</code> just tells React Native which component is the root one for the whole application. You won't be thinking about <code>AppRegistry</code> a lot - there will probably just be one call to <code>AppRegistry.registerComponent</code> in your whole app. It's included in these examples so you can paste the whole thing into your <code>index.ios.js</code> or <code>index.android.js</code> file and get it running.</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-app-doesn-t-do-very-much\">\nThis App Doesn't Do Very Much </h2>\n<p>Good point. To make components do more interesting things, you need to <a href=\"props\">learn about Props</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Tutorial.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass FixedDimensionsBasics extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} /&gt;\n        &lt;View style={{width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} /&gt;\n        &lt;View style={{width: 150, height: 150, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} /&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () =&gt; FixedDimensionsBasics);</pre>\n<p>Setting dimensions this way is common for components that should always render at exactly the same size, regardless of screen dimensions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"flex-dimensions\">\nFlex Dimensions </h4>\n<p>Use <code>flex</code> in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use <code>flex: 1</code>, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst each other component with the same parent. The larger the <code>flex</code> given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than 0. If a parent does not have either a fixed <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> or <code>flex</code>, the parent will have dimensions of 0 and the <code>flex</code> children will not be visible.</p></blockquote>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass FlexDimensionsBasics extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // Try removing the `flex: 1` on the parent View.\n      // The parent will not have dimensions, so the children can't expand.\n      // What if you add `height: 300` instead of `flex: 1`?\n      &lt;View style={{flex: 1}}&gt;\n        &lt;View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} /&gt;\n        &lt;View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} /&gt;\n        &lt;View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} /&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () =&gt; FlexDimensionsBasics);</pre>\n<p>After you can control a component's size, the next step is to <a href=\"flexbox\">learn how to lay it out on the screen</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/HeightAndWidth.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

For data that is going to change, we have to use <code>state</code>.</p>\n<p>In general, you should initialize <code>state</code> in the constructor, and then call <code>setState</code> when you want to change it.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say we want to make text that blinks all the time. The text itself gets set once when the blinking component gets created, so the text itself is a <code>prop</code>. The \"whether the text is currently on or off\" changes over time, so that should be kept in <code>state</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass Blink extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {showText: true};\n\n    // Toggle the state every second\n    setInterval(() =&gt; {\n      this.setState({ showText: !this.state.showText });\n    }, 1000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    let display = this.state.showText ? this.props.text : ' ';\n    return (\n      &lt;Text&gt;{display}&lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass BlinkApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Blink text='I love to blink' /&gt;\n        &lt;Blink text='Yes blinking is so great' /&gt;\n        &lt;Blink text='Why did they ever take this out of HTML' /&gt;\n        &lt;Blink text='Look at me look at me look at me' /&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BlinkApp', () =&gt; BlinkApp);</pre>\n<p>In a real application, you probably won't be setting state with a timer. You might set state when you have new data arrive from the server, or from user input. You can also use a state container like <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/index.html\">Redux</a> to control your data flow. In that case you would use Redux to modify your state rather than calling <code>setState</code> directly.</p>\n<p>State works the same way as it does in React, so for more details on handling state, you can look at the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html\">React.Component API</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, you might be annoyed that most of our examples so far use boring default black text.

The tests themselves live in the <code>__tests__</code> directories of the files they test, and there is a large emphasis on aggressively mocking out functionality that is not under test for failure isolation and maximum speed. You can run the existing React Native jest tests with</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">npm test</pre>\n<p>from the react-native root, and we encourage you to add your own tests for any components you want to contribute to. See <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/Movies/__tests__/getImageSource-test.js\"><code>getImageSource-test.js</code></a> for a basic example.</p>\n<p>Note: In order to run your own tests, you will have to first follow the Getting Started instructions on the Jest page and then include the <code>jest</code> objects below in <code>package.json</code> so that the scripts are pre-processed before execution.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">...\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"test\": \"jest\"\n},\n...\n\"jest\": {\n  \"scriptPreprocessor\": \"node_modules/react-native/jestSupport/preprocessor.js\",\n  \"setupEnvScriptFile\": \"node_modules/react-native/jestSupport/env.js\",\n  \"testPathIgnorePatterns\": [\n    \"/node_modules/\",\n    \"packager/react-packager/src/Activity/\"\n  ],\n  \"testFileExtensions\": [\n    \"js\"\n  ],\n  \"unmockedModulePathPatterns\": [\n    \"promise\",\n    \"source-map\"\n  ]\n},\n...</pre>\n<p>Note: you may have to install/upgrade/link Node.js and other parts of your environment in order for the tests to run correctly.

Unit tests run locally on your machine, no emulator is needed. To run the tests:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">$ cd react-native\n$ ./scripts/run-android-local-unit-tests.sh</pre>\n<h2 id=\"integration-tests-android\">\nIntegration tests (Android) </h2>\n<p>React Native uses the <a href=\"https://buckbuild.com/setup/install.html\">Buck build tool</a> to run tests. Integration tests run on an emulator / device and verify that modules and components, as well as the core parts of React Native (such as the bridge) work well end-to-end.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have the path to the Android NDK set up, see <a href=\"android-building-from-source#prerequisites\">Prerequisites</a>.</p>\n<p>To run the tests:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">$ cd react-native\n$ npm install\n$ ./scripts/run-android-local-integration-tests.sh</pre>\n<h2 id=\"integration-tests-ios\">\nIntegration Tests (iOS) </h2>\n<p>React Native provides facilities to make it easier to test integrated components that require both native and JS components to communicate across the bridge. The two main components are <code>RCTTestRunner</code> and <code>RCTTestModule</code>. <code>RCTTestRunner</code> sets up the ReactNative environment and provides facilities to run the tests as <code>XCTestCase</code>s in Xcode (<code>runTest:module</code> is the simplest method). <code>RCTTestModule</code> is exported to JS as <code>NativeModules.TestModule</code>. The tests themselves are written in JS, and must call <code>TestModule.markTestCompleted()</code> when they are done, otherwise the test will timeout and fail. Test failures are primarily indicated by throwing a JS exception. It is also possible to test error conditions with <code>runTest:module:initialProps:expectErrorRegex:</code> or <code>runTest:module:initialProps:expectErrorBlock:</code> which will expect an error to be thrown and verify the error matches the provided criteria. See <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/IntegrationTests/IntegrationTestHarnessTest.js\"><code>IntegrationTestHarnessTest.js</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/UIExplorerIntegrationTests/UIExplorerIntegrationTests.m\"><code>UIExplorerIntegrationTests.m</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/IntegrationTests/IntegrationTestsApp.js\">IntegrationTestsApp.js</a> for example usage and integration points.</p>\n<p>You can run integration tests locally with cmd+U in the IntegrationTest and UIExplorer apps in Xcode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"snapshot-tests-ios\">\nSnapshot Tests (iOS) </h2>\n<p>A common type of integration test is the snapshot test. These tests render a component, and verify snapshots of the screen against reference images using <code>TestModule.verifySnapshot()</code>, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case\"><code>FBSnapshotTestCase</code></a> library behind the scenes. Reference images are recorded by setting <code>recordMode = YES</code> on the <code>RCTTestRunner</code>, then running the tests. Snapshots will differ slightly between 32 and 64 bit, and various OS versions, so it's recommended that you enforce tests are run with the correct configuration. It's also highly recommended that all network data be mocked out, along with other potentially troublesome dependencies. See <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/IntegrationTests/SimpleSnapshotTest.js\"><code>SimpleSnapshotTest</code></a> for a basic example.</p>\n<p>If you make a change that affects a snapshot test in a PR, such as adding a new example case to one of the examples that is snapshotted, you'll need to re-record the snapshot reference image. To do this, simply change to <code>_runner.recordMode = YES;</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/UIExplorerIntegrationTests/UIExplorerSnapshotTests.m#L42\">UIExplorer/UIExplorerSnapshotTests.m</a>, re-run the failing tests, then flip record back to <code>NO</code> and submit/update your PR and wait to see if the Travis build passes.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Testing.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

You just style your application using JavaScript. All of the core components accept a prop named <code>style</code>. The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web, except names are written like <code>backgroundColor</code> instead of like <code>background-color</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>style</code> prop can be a plain old JavaScript object. That's the simplest and what we usually use for example code. You can also pass an array of styles - the last style in the array has precedence, so you can use this to inherit styles.</p>\n<p>As a component grows in complexity, it is often cleaner to use <code>StyleSheet.create</code> to define several styles in one place. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass LotsOfStyles extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={styles.red}&gt;just red&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={styles.bigblue}&gt;just bigblue&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={[styles.bigblue, styles.red]}&gt;bigblue, then red&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={[styles.red, styles.bigblue]}&gt;red, then bigblue&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  bigblue: {\n    color: 'blue',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    fontSize: 30,\n  },\n  red: {\n    color: 'red',\n  },\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('LotsOfStyles', () =&gt; LotsOfStyles);</pre>\n<p>One common pattern is to make your component accept a <code>style</code> prop which in turn is used to style subcomponents. You can use this to make styles \"cascade\" the way they do in CSS.</p>\n<p>There are a lot more ways to customize text style. Check out the <a href=\"text\">Text component reference</a> for a complete list.</p>\n<p>Now you can make your text beautiful. The next step in becoming a style master is to <a href=\"height-and-width\">learn how to control component size</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Style.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

Where possible, we would like for React Native to do the right thing and help you to focus on your app instead of performance optimization, but there are areas where we're not quite there yet, and others where React Native (similar to writing native code directly) cannot possibly determine the best way to optimize for you and so manual intervention will be necessary.</p>\n<p>This guide is intended to teach you some basics to help you to troubleshoot performance issues, as well as discuss common sources of problems and their suggested solutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-you-need-to-know-about-frames\">\nWhat you need to know about frames </h3>\n<p>Your grandparents' generation called movies <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1i40rnpOsA\">\"moving pictures\"</a> for a reason: realistic motion in video is an illusion created by quickly changing static images at a consistent speed. We refer to each of these images as frames. The number of frames that is displayed each second has a direct impact on how smooth and ultimately life-like a video (or user interface) seems to be. iOS devices display 60 frames per second, which gives you and the UI system about 16.67ms to do all of the work needed to generate the static image (frame) that the user will see on the screen for that interval. If you are unable to do the work necessary to generate that frame within the allotted 16.67ms, then you will \"drop a frame\" and the UI will appear unresponsive.</p>\n<p>Now to confuse the matter a little bit, open up the developer menu in your app and toggle <code>Show FPS Monitor</code>. You will notice that there are two different frame rates.</p>\n<h4 id=\"javascript-frame-rate\">\nJavaScript frame rate </h4>\n<p>For most React Native applications, your business logic will run on the JavaScript thread. This is where your React application lives, API calls are made, touch events are processed, etc... Updates to native-backed views are batched and sent over to the native side at the end of each iteration of the event loop, before the frame deadline (if all goes well). If the JavaScript thread is unresponsive for a frame, it will be considered a dropped frame. For example, if you were to call <code>this.setState</code> on the root component of a complex application and it resulted in re-rendering computationally expensive component subtrees, it's conceivable that this might take 200ms and result in 12 frames being dropped. Any animations controlled by JavaScript would appear to freeze during that time. If anything takes longer than 100ms, the user will feel it.</p>\n<p>This often happens during Navigator transitions: when you push a new route, the JavaScript thread needs to render all of the components necessary for the scene in order to send over the proper commands to the native side to create the backing views. It's common for the work being done here to take a few frames and cause jank because the transition is controlled by the JavaScript thread. Sometimes components will do additional work on <code>componentDidMount</code>, which might result in a second stutter in the transition.</p>\n<p>Another example is responding to touches: if you are doing work across multiple frames on the JavaScript thread, you might notice a delay in responding to TouchableOpacity, for example. This is because the JavaScript thread is busy and cannot process the raw touch events sent over from the main thread. As a result, TouchableOpacity cannot react to the touch events and command the native view to adjust its opacity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"main-thread-aka-ui-thread-frame-rate\">\nMain thread (aka UI thread) frame rate </h4>\n<p>Many people have noticed that performance of <code>NavigatorIOS</code> is better out of the box than <code>Navigator</code>. The reason for this is that the animations for the transitions are done entirely on the main thread, and so they are not interrupted by frame drops on the JavaScript thread. (<a href=\"navigator-comparison\">Read about why you should probably use Navigator anyways.</a>)</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can happily scroll up and down through a ScrollView when the JavaScript thread is locked up because the ScrollView lives on the main thread (the scroll events are dispatched to the JS thread though, but their receipt is not necessary for the scroll to occur).</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-sources-of-performance-problems\">\nCommon sources of performance problems </h3>\n<h4 id=\"console-log-statements\">\nConsole.log statements </h4>\n<p>When running a bundled app, these statements can cause a big bottleneck in the JavaScript thread. This includes calls from debugging libraries such as <a href=\"https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger\">redux-logger</a>, so make sure to remove them before bundling.</p>\n<h4 id=\"development-mode-dev-true\">\nDevelopment mode (dev=true) </h4>\n<p>JavaScript thread performance suffers greatly when running in dev mode. This is unavoidable: a lot more work needs to be done at runtime to provide you with good warnings and error messages, such as validating propTypes and various other assertions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"slow-navigator-transitions\">\nSlow navigator transitions </h4>\n<p>As mentioned above, <code>Navigator</code> animations are controlled by the JavaScript thread. Imagine the \"push from right\" scene transition: each frame, the new scene is moved from the right to left, starting offscreen (let's say at an x-offset of 320) and ultimately settling when the scene sits at an x-offset of 0. Each frame during this transition, the JavaScript thread needs to send a new x-offset to the main thread. If the JavaScript thread is locked up, it cannot do this and so no update occurs on that frame and the animation stutters.</p>\n<p>Part of the long-term solution to this is to allow for JavaScript-based animations to be offloaded to the main thread. If we were to do the same thing as in the above example with this approach, we might calculate a list of all x-offsets for the new scene when we are starting the transition and send them to the main thread to execute in an optimized way. Now that the JavaScript thread is freed of this responsibility, it's not a big deal if it drops a few frames while rendering the scene -- you probably won't even notice because you will be too distracted by the pretty transition.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this solution is not yet implemented, and so in the meantime we should use the InteractionManager to selectively render the minimal amount of content necessary for the new scene as long as the animation is in progress. <code>InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions</code> takes a callback as its only argument, and that callback is fired when the navigator transition is complete (each animation from the <code>Animated</code> API also notifies the InteractionManager, but that's beyond the scope of this discussion).</p>\n<p>Your scene component might look something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class ExpensiveScene extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n    this.state = {renderPlaceholderOnly: true};\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() =&gt; {\n      this.setState({renderPlaceholderOnly: false});\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.renderPlaceholderOnly) {\n      return this._renderPlaceholderView();\n    }\n\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Your full view goes here&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n\n\n  _renderPlaceholderView() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Loading...&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n};</pre>\n<p>You don't need to be limited to rendering some loading indicator, you could alternatively render part of your content -- for example, when you load the Facebook app you see a placeholder news feed item with grey rectangles where text will be. If you are rendering a Map in your new scene, you might want to display a grey placeholder view or a spinner until the transition is complete as this can actually cause frames to be dropped on the main thread.</p>\n<h4 id=\"listview-initial-rendering-is-too-slow-or-scroll-performance-is-bad-for-large-lists\">\nListView initial rendering is too slow or scroll performance is bad for large lists </h4>\n<p>This is an issue that comes up frequently because iOS ships with UITableView which gives you very good performance by re-using underlying UIViews. Work is in progress to do something similar with React Native, but until then we have some tools at our disposal to help us tweak the performance to suit our needs. It may not be possible to get all the way there, but a little bit of creativity and experimentation with these options can go a long way.</p>\n<h5 id=\"initiallistsize\">\ninitialListSize </h5>\n<p>This prop specifies how many rows we want to render on our first render pass. If we are concerned with getting <em>something</em> on screen as quickly as possible, we could set the <code>initialListSize</code> to 1, and we'll quickly see other rows fill in on subsequent frames. The number of rows per frame is determined by the <code>pageSize</code>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"pagesize\">\npageSize </h5>\n<p>After the initial render where <code>initialListSize</code> is used, ListView looks at the <code>pageSize</code> to determine how many rows to render per frame. The default here is 1 -- but if your views are very small and inexpensive to render, you might want to bump this up. Tweak it and find what works for your use case.</p>\n<h5 id=\"scrollrenderaheaddistance\">\nscrollRenderAheadDistance </h5>\n<p>\"How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in pixels.\"</p>\n<p>If we had a list with 2000 items and rendered them all immediately that would be a poor use of both memory and computational resources. It would also probably cause some pretty awful jank. So the scrollRenderAhead distance allows us to specify how far beyond the current viewport we should continue to render rows.</p>\n<h5 id=\"removeclippedsubviews\">\nremoveClippedSubviews </h5>\n<p>\"When true, offscreen child views (whose <code>overflow</code> value is <code>hidden</code>) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen. This can improve scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is <code>true</code>.\"(The default value is <code>false</code> before version 0.14-rc).</p>\n<p>This is an extremely important optimization to apply on large ListViews. On Android the <code>overflow</code> value is always <code>hidden</code> so you don't need to worry about setting it, but on iOS you need to be sure to set <code>overflow:\nhidden</code> on row containers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"my-component-renders-too-slowly-and-i-don-t-need-it-all-immediately\">\nMy component renders too slowly and I don't need it all immediately </h4>\n<p>It's common at first to overlook ListView, but using it properly is often key to achieving solid performance. As discussed above, it provides you with a set of tools that lets you split rendering of your view across various frames and tweak that behavior to fit your specific needs. Remember that ListView can be horizontal too.</p>\n<h4 id=\"js-fps-plunges-when-re-rendering-a-view-that-hardly-changes\">\nJS FPS plunges when re-rendering a view that hardly changes </h4>\n<p>If you are using a ListView, you must provide a <code>rowHasChanged</code> function that can reduce a lot of work by quickly determining whether or not a row needs to be re-rendered. If you are using immutable data structures, this would be as simple as a reference equality check.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can implement <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> and indicate the exact conditions under which you would like the component to re-render. If you write pure components (where the return value of the render function is entirely dependent on props and state), you can leverage PureRenderMixin to do this for you. Once again, immutable data structures are useful to keep this fast -- if you have to do a deep comparison of a large list of objects, it may be that re-rendering your entire component would be quicker, and it would certainly require less code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dropping-js-thread-fps-because-of-doing-a-lot-of-work-on-the-javascript-thread-at-the-same-time\">\nDropping JS thread FPS because of doing a lot of work on the JavaScript thread at the same time </h4>\n<p>\"Slow Navigator transitions\" is the most common manifestation of this, but there are other times this can happen. Using InteractionManager can be a good approach, but if the user experience cost is too high to delay work during an animation, then you might want to consider LayoutAnimation.</p>\n<p>The Animated api currently calculates each keyframe on-demand on the JavaScript thread, while LayoutAnimation leverages Core Animation and is unaffected by JS thread and main thread frame drops.</p>\n<p>One case where I have used this is for animating in a modal (sliding down from top and fading in a translucent overlay) while initializing and perhaps receiving responses for several network requests, rendering the contents of the modal, and updating the view where the modal was opened from. See the Animations guide for more information about how to use LayoutAnimation.</p>\n<p>Caveats: - LayoutAnimation only works for fire-and-forget animations (\"static\" animations) -- if it must be be interruptible, you will need to use Animated.</p>\n<h4 id=\"moving-a-view-on-the-screen-scrolling-translating-rotating-drops-ui-thread-fps\">\nMoving a view on the screen (scrolling, translating, rotating) drops UI thread FPS </h4>\n<p>This is especially true when you have text with a transparent background positioned on top of an image, or any other situation where alpha compositing would be required to re-draw the view on each frame. You will find that enabling <code>shouldRasterizeIOS</code> or <code>renderToHardwareTextureAndroid</code> can help with this significantly.</p>\n<p>Be careful not to overuse this or your memory usage could go through the roof. Profile your performance and memory usage when using these props. If you don't plan to move a view anymore, turn this property off.</p>\n<h4 id=\"animating-the-size-of-an-image-drops-ui-thread-fps\">\nAnimating the size of an image drops UI thread FPS </h4>\n<p>On iOS, each time you adjust the width or height of an Image component it is re-cropped and scaled from the original image. This can be very expensive, especially for large images. Instead, use the <code>transform: [{scale}]</code> style property to animate the size. An example of when you might do this is when you tap an image and zoom it in to full screen.</p>\n<h4 id=\"my-touchablex-view-isn-t-very-responsive\">\nMy TouchableX view isn't very responsive </h4>\n<p>Sometimes, if we do an action in the same frame that we are adjusting the opacity or highlight of a component that is responding to a touch, we won't see that effect until after the <code>onPress</code> function has returned. If <code>onPress</code> does a <code>setState</code> that results in a lot of work and a few frames dropped, this may occur. A solution to this is to wrap any action inside of your <code>onPress</code> handler in <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">handleOnPress() {\n  // Always use TimerMixin with requestAnimationFrame, setTimeout and\n  // setInterval\n  this.requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt; {\n    this.doExpensiveAction();\n  });\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"profiling\">\nProfiling </h3>\n<p>Use the built-in Profiler to get detailed information about work done in the JavaScript thread and main thread side-by-side.</p>\n<p>For iOS, Instruments are an invaluable tool, and on Android you should learn to use systrace.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Performance.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

If you are just getting started with navigation, you will probably want to use <code>Navigator</code>. If you are only targeting iOS and would like to stick to the native look and feel, check out <code>NavigatorIOS</code>. If you are looking for greater control over your navigation stack, you can't go wrong with <code>NavigationExperimental</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"navigator\">\nNavigator </h2>\n<p><code>Navigator</code> provides a JavaScript implementation of a navigation stack, so it works on both iOS and Android and is easy to customize. This is the same component you used to build your first navigation stack in the <a href=\"navigators\">navigators tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/img/NavigationStack-Navigator.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><code>Navigator</code> can easily be adapted to render different components based on the current route in its <code>renderScene</code> function. It will transition new scenes onto the screen by sliding in from the right by default, but you can control this behavior by using the <code>configureScene</code> function. You can also configure a navigation bar through the <code>navigationBar</code> prop.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"navigator\">Navigator API reference</a> for specific examples that cover each of these scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"navigatorios\">\nNavigatorIOS </h2>\n<p>If you are targeting iOS only, you may also want to consider using <a href=\"navigatorios\">NavigatorIOS</a>. It looks and feels just like <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/\"><code>UINavigationController</code></a>, because it is actually built on top of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/img/NavigationStack-NavigatorIOS.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;NavigatorIOS\n  initialRoute={{\n    component: MyScene,\n    title: 'My Initial Scene',\n    passProps: { myProp: 'foo' },\n  }}\n/&gt;</pre>\n<p>Just like <code>Navigator</code>, <code>NavigatorIOS</code> uses routes to represent scenes, with some important differences. The actual component that will be rendered can be specified using the <code>component</code> key in the route, and any props that should be passed to this component can be specified in <code>passProps</code>. A \"navigator\" object is automatically passed as a prop to the component, allowing you to call <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> as needed.</p>\n<p>As <code>NavigatorIOS</code> leverages native UIKit navigation, it will automatically render a navigation bar with a back button and title.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { NavigatorIOS, Text, TouchableHighlight, View } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class NavigatorIOSApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;NavigatorIOS\n        initialRoute={{\n          component: MyScene,\n          title: 'My Initial Scene',\n        }}\n        style={{flex: 1}}\n      /&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyScene extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    navigator: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n  }\n\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n    this._onForward = this._onForward.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  _onForward() {\n    this.props.navigator.push({\n      title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Current Scene: { this.props.title }&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onForward}&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Tap me to load the next scene&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"navigatorios\"><code>NavigatorIOS</code> reference docs</a> to learn more about this component.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You may also want to check out <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation\">react-native-navigation</a>, a component that aims to provide native navigation on both iOS and Android.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"navigationexperimental\">\nNavigationExperimental </h2>\n<p><code>Navigator</code> and <code>NavigatorIOS</code> are both stateful components. If your app has multiple of these, it can become tricky to coordinate navigation transitions between them. NavigationExperimental provides a different approach to navigation, allowing any view to act as a navigation view and using reducers to manipulate state at a top-level object. It is bleeding edge as the name implies, but you might want to check it out if you are craving greater control over your app's navigation.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;NavigationCardStack\n  onNavigateBack={onPopRouteFunc}\n  navigationState={myNavigationState}\n  renderScene={renderSceneFun}\n/&gt;</pre>\n<p>You can import <code>NavigationExperimental</code> like any other component in React Native. Once you have that, you can deconstruct any additional components from <code>NavigationExperimental</code> that you may find useful. Since I am feeling like building navigation stacks today, I'll go ahead and pick out <code>NavigationCardStack</code> and <code>NavigationStateUtils</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { NavigationExperimental } from 'react-native';\n\nconst {\n  CardStack: NavigationCardStack,\n  StateUtils: NavigationStateUtils,\n} = NavigationExperimental;</pre>\n<p>As I said earlier, <code>NavigationExperimental</code> takes a different approach than <code>Navigator</code> and <code>NavigatorIOS</code>. Using it to build a navigation stack requires a few more steps than the stateful components, but the payoff is worth it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-1-define-initial-state-and-top-level-component\">\nStep 1. Define Initial State and Top Level Component </h3>\n<p>Create a new component for your application. This will be the top-level object, so we will define the initial state here. The navigation state will be defined in the <code>navigationState</code> key, where we define our initial route:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class BleedingEdgeApplication extends Component {\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n\n    this.state = {\n      // This defines the initial navigation state.\n      navigationState: {\n        index: 0, // Starts with first route focused.\n        routes: [{key: 'My Initial Scene'}], // Starts with only one route.\n      },\n    };\n\n    // We'll define this function later - hang on\n    this._onNavigationChange = this._onNavigationChange.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  _onNavigationChange(type) {\n    // It's literally the next step. We'll get to it!\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Text&gt;This is a placeholder. We will come back to this and render our navigation here later.&lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Alright, now we have a simple stateful component that doesn't do much at all. We can change that. Our initial state contains one route, and the current index. That looks suspiciously just like our initial route definition in Navigator. Do you remember which actions its navigator object provided?</p>\n<p>Push and pop, of course. That seems pretty straightforward to implement. I promised you earlier we would be using reducers to manage state at the top-level object. Sit tight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-2-reducing-the-navigation-state\">\nStep 2. Reducing the Navigation State </h3>\n<p>NavigationExperimental comes built-in with a some useful reducers, and they are all available as part of NavigationStateUtils. The two we will be using right now are called -- yep -- push and pop. They take a navigationState object, and return a new navigationState object.</p>\n<p>We can use them to write our <code>_onNavigationChange</code> function which, given a \"push\" or \"pop\" action, will reduce the state accordingly.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">_onNavigationChange(type) {\n  // Extract the navigationState from the current state:\n  let {navigationState} = this.state;\n\n  switch (type) {\n    case 'push':\n      // Push a new route, which in our case is an object with a key value.\n      // I am fond of cryptic keys (but seriously, keys should be unique)\n      const route = {key: 'Route-' + Date.now()};\n\n      // Use the push reducer provided by NavigationStateUtils\n      navigationState = NavigationStateUtils.push(navigationState, route);\n      break;\n\n    case 'pop':\n      // Pop the current route using the pop reducer.\n      navigationState = NavigationStateUtils.pop(navigationState);\n      break;\n  }\n\n  // NavigationStateUtils gives you back the same `navigationState` if nothing\n  // has changed. We will only update state if it has changed.\n  if (this.state.navigationState !== navigationState) {\n    // Always use setState() when setting a new state!\n    this.setState({navigationState});\n    // If you are new to ES6, the above is equivalent to:\n    // this.setState({navigationState: navigationState});\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Cool. I'm getting the hang of this. This is the heart of NavigationExperimental. We are only handling two actions here, but a more complex application could also take into account a \"back\" action (e.g. Android back button), as well as handle the transition between several tabs in a tabbed application.</p>\n<p>I am still missing the initial scene that will be rendered (as well as the actual navigator that will wrap it, but let's not get ahead of ourselves).</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-3-define-scenes\">\nStep 3. Define Scenes </h3>\n<p>First I want to define a Row component out of convenience. It displays some text and can call some function when pressed.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class TappableRow extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;TouchableHighlight\n        style={styles.row}\n        underlayColor=\"#D0D0D0\"\n        onPress={this.props.onPress}&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={styles.buttonText}&gt;\n          {this.props.text}\n        &lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Now I will define my actual scene. It uses a scroll view to display a vertical list of items. The first row displays the current route's key, and two more rows will call our theoretical navigator's push and pop functions.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyVeryComplexScene extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;ScrollView style={styles.scrollView}&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={styles.row}&gt;\n          Route: {this.props.route.key}\n        &lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;TappableRow\n          text=\"Tap me to load the next scene\"\n          onPress={this.props.onPushRoute}\n        /&gt;\n        &lt;TappableRow\n          text=\"Tap me to go back\"\n          onPress={this.props.onPopRoute}\n        /&gt;\n      &lt;/ScrollView&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"step-4-create-a-navigation-stack\">\nStep 4. Create a Navigation Stack </h3>\n<p>Now that I have defined the state and a function to manage it, I think I can go ahead and create a proper navigator component now. While I'm at it, I'll render my scene after configuring it with the current route's props.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyVerySimpleNavigator extends Component {\n\n  // This sets up the methods (e.g. Pop, Push) for navigation.\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n\n    this._onPushRoute = this.props.onNavigationChange.bind(null, 'push');\n    this._onPopRoute = this.props.onNavigationChange.bind(null, 'pop');\n\n    this._renderScene = this._renderScene.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  // Now we finally get to use the `NavigationCardStack` to render the scenes.\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;NavigationCardStack\n        onNavigateBack={this._onPopRoute}\n        navigationState={this.props.navigationState}\n        renderScene={this._renderScene}\n        style={styles.navigator}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n\n  // Render a scene for route.\n  // The detailed spec of `sceneProps` is defined at `NavigationTypeDefinition`\n  // as type `NavigationSceneRendererProps`.\n  // Here you could choose to render a different component for each route, but\n  // we'll keep it simple.\n  _renderScene(sceneProps) {\n    return (\n      &lt;MyVeryComplexScene\n        route={sceneProps.scene.route}\n        onPushRoute={this._onPushRoute}\n        onPopRoute={this._onPopRoute}\n        onExit={this.props.onExit}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>That's it -- so close to the finish line I can smell it. Let's plug our new navigator into our top-level component:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class BleedingEdgeApplication extends Component {\n\n  // constructor and other methods omitted for clarity\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;MyVerySimpleNavigator\n        navigationState={this.state.navigationState}\n        onNavigationChange={this._onNavigationChange}\n        onExit={this._exit}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>We're done! Bask in the glory of NavigationExperimental.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hey-i-think-you-are-missing-something\">\nHey -- I think you are missing something. </h4>\n<p>(Oh yes, sorry about that -- here's our missing imports and styles.)</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { NavigationExperimental, PixelRatio, ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text, TouchableHighlight } from 'react-native';\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  navigator: {\n    flex: 1,\n  },\n  scrollView: {\n    marginTop: 64\n  },\n  row: {\n    padding: 15,\n    backgroundColor: 'white',\n    borderBottomWidth: 1 / PixelRatio.get(),\n    borderBottomColor: '#CDCDCD',\n  },\n  rowText: {\n    fontSize: 17,\n  },\n  buttonText: {\n    fontSize: 17,\n    fontWeight: '500',\n  },\n});</pre>\n<h3 id=\"homework\">\nHomework </h3>\n<p>You are now an expert navigator.

It has an <code>onChangeText</code> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an <code>onSubmitEditing</code> prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence \"Hello there Bob\" would be translated as \"🍕🍕🍕\".</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass PizzaTranslator extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {text: ''};\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={{padding: 10}}&gt;\n        &lt;TextInput\n          style={{height: 40}}\n          placeholder=\"Type here to translate!\"\n          onChangeText={(text) =&gt; this.setState({text})}\n        /&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={{padding: 10, fontSize: 42}}&gt;\n          {this.state.text.split(' ').map((word) =&gt; word &amp;&amp; '🍕').join(' ')}\n        &lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('PizzaTranslator', () =&gt; PizzaTranslator);</pre>\n<p>In this example, we store <code>text</code> in the state, because it changes over time.</p>\n<p>There are a lot more things you might want to do with a text input. For example, you could validate the text inside while the user types. For more detailed examples, see the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html\">React docs on controlled components</a>, or the <a href=\"textinput\">reference docs for TextInput</a>.</p>\n<p>Text input is probably the simplest example of a component whose state naturally changes over time.

They can use a combination of gestures, such as tapping on a button, scrolling a list, or zooming on a map.</p>\n<p>React Native provides components to handle common gestures, such as taps and swipes, as well as a comprehensive <a href=\"gesturerespondersystem\">gesture responder system</a> to allow for more advanced gesture recognition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tappable-components\">\nTappable Components </h2>\n<p>You can use \"Touchable\" components when you want to capture a tapping gesture. They take a function through the <code>onPress</code> props which will be called when the touch begins and ends within the bounds of the component.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyButton extends Component {\n  _onPressButton() {\n    console.log(\"You tapped the button!\");\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onPressButton}&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Button&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Tappable components should provide feedback that show the user what is handling their touch, and what will happen when they lift their finger. The user should also be able to cancel a tap by dragging their finger away.</p>\n<p>Which component you use will depend on what kind of feedback you want to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Generally, you can use <a href=\"touchablehighlight\"><strong>TouchableHighlight</strong></a> anywhere you would use a button or link on web. The view's background will be darkened when the user presses down on the button.</p></li>\n<li><p>You may consider using <a href=\"touchablenativefeedback\"><strong>TouchableNativeFeedback</strong></a> on Android to display ink surface reaction ripples that respond to the user's touch.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"touchableopacity\"><strong>TouchableOpacity</strong></a> can be used to provide feedback by reducing the opacity of the button, allowing the background to be seen through while the user is pressing down.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you need to handle a tap gesture but you don't want any feedback to be displayed, use <a href=\"touchablewithoutfeedback\"><strong>TouchableWithoutFeedback</strong></a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"long-presses\">\nLong presses </h3>\n<p>In some cases, you may want to detect when a user presses and holds a view for a set amount of time. These long presses can be handled by passing a function to the <code>onLongPress</code> props of any of the touchable components listed above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scrolling-lists-and-swiping-views\">\nScrolling lists and swiping views </h2>\n<p>A common pattern to many mobile apps is the scrollable list of items. Users interact with these using panning or swiping gestures. The <a href=\"using-a-scrollview\">ScrollView</a> component displays a list of items that can be scrolled using these gestures.</p>\n<p>ScrollViews can scroll vertically or horizontally, and can be configured to allow paging through views using swiping gestures by using the <code>pagingEnabled</code> props. Swiping horizontally between views can also be implemented on Android using the <a href=\"viewpagerandroid\">ViewPagerAndroid</a> component.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"using-a-listview\">ListView</a> is a special kind of ScrollView that is best suited for displaying long vertical lists of items. It can also display section headers and footers, similar to <code>UITableView</code>s on iOS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pinch-to-zoom\">\nPinch-to-zoom </h3>\n<p>A ScrollView with a single item can be used to allow the user to zoom content. Set up the <code>maximumZoomScale</code> and <code>minimumZoomScale</code> props and your user will be able to use pinch and expand gestures to zoom in and out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"handling-additional-gestures\">\nHandling additional gestures </h2>\n<p>If you want to allow a user to drag a view around the screen, or you want to implement your own custom pan/drag gesture, take a look at the <a href=\"panresponder\">PanResponder</a> API or the <a href=\"gesturerespondersystem\">gesture responder system docs</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/HandlingTouches.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

In addition, both platforms provide bundled assistive technologies, like the screen readers VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android) for the visually impaired. Similarly, in React Native we have included APIs designed to provide developers with support for making apps more accessible. Take note, iOS and Android differ slightly in their approaches, and thus the React Native implementations may vary by platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-apps-accessible\">\nMaking Apps Accessible </h2>\n<h3 id=\"accessibility-properties\">\nAccessibility properties </h3>\n<h4 id=\"accessible-ios-android\">\naccessible (iOS, Android) </h4>\n<p>When <code>true</code>, indicates that the view is an accessibility element. When a view is an accessibility element, it groups its children into a single selectable component. By default, all touchable elements are accessible.</p>\n<p>On Android, ‘accessible={true}’ property for a react-native View will be translated into native ‘focusable={true}’.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;View accessible={true}&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;text one&lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;text two&lt;/Text&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example, we can't get accessibility focus separately on 'text one' and 'text two'. Instead we get focus on a parent view with 'accessible' property.</p>\n<h4 id=\"accessibilitylabel-ios-android\">\naccessibilityLabel (iOS, Android) </h4>\n<p>When a view is marked as accessible, it is a good practice to set an accessibilityLabel on the view, so that people who use VoiceOver know what element they have selected. VoiceOver will read this string when a user selects the associated element.</p>\n<p>To use, set the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> property to a custom string on your View:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;TouchableOpacity accessible={true} accessibilityLabel={'Tap me!'} onPress={this._onPress}&gt;\n  &lt;View style={styles.button}&gt;\n    &lt;Text style={styles.buttonText}&gt;Press me!&lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/View&gt;\n&lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example, the <code>accessibilityLabel</code> on the TouchableOpacity element would default to \"Press me!\". The label is constructed by concatenating all Text node children separated by spaces.</p>\n<h4 id=\"accessibilitytraits-ios\">\naccessibilityTraits (iOS) </h4>\n<p>Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected. Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by <code>accessibilityTraits</code>.</p>\n<p>To use, set the <code>accessibilityTraits</code> property to one of (or an array of) accessibility trait strings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>none</strong> Used when the element has no traits.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>button</strong> Used when the element should be treated as a button.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>link</strong> Used when the element should be treated as a link.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>header</strong> Used when an element acts as a header for a content section (e.g. the title of a navigation bar).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>search</strong> Used when the text field element should also be treated as a search field.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>image</strong> Used when the element should be treated as an image. Can be combined with button or link, for example.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>selected</strong> Used when the element is selected. For example, a selected row in a table or a selected button within a segmented control.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>plays</strong> Used when the element plays its own sound when activated.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>key</strong> Used when the element acts as a keyboard key.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>text</strong> Used when the element should be treated as static text that cannot change.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>summary</strong> Used when an element can be used to provide a quick summary of current conditions in the app when the app first launches. For example, when Weather first launches, the element with today's weather conditions is marked with this trait.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>disabled</strong> Used when the control is not enabled and does not respond to user input.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>frequentUpdates</strong> Used when the element frequently updates its label or value, but too often to send notifications. Allows an accessibility client to poll for changes. A stopwatch would be an example.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>startsMedia</strong> Used when activating an element starts a media session (e.g. playing a movie, recording audio) that should not be interrupted by output from an assistive technology, like VoiceOver.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>adjustable</strong> Used when an element can be \"adjusted\" (e.g. a slider).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>allowsDirectInteraction</strong> Used when an element allows direct touch interaction for VoiceOver users (for example, a view representing a piano keyboard).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>pageTurn</strong> Informs VoiceOver that it should scroll to the next page when it finishes reading the contents of the element.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"onaccessibilitytap-ios\">\nonAccessibilityTap (iOS) </h4>\n<p>Use this property to assign a custom function to be called when someone activates an accessible element by double tapping on it while it's selected.</p>\n<h4 id=\"onmagictap-ios\">\nonMagicTap (iOS) </h4>\n<p>Assign this property to a custom function which will be called when someone performs the \"magic tap\" gesture, which is a double-tap with two fingers. A magic tap function should perform the most relevant action a user could take on a component. In the Phone app on iPhone, a magic tap answers a phone call, or ends the current one. If the selected element does not have an <code>onMagicTap</code> function, the system will traverse up the view hierarchy until it finds a view that does.</p>\n<h4 id=\"accessibilitycomponenttype-android\">\naccessibilityComponentType (Android) </h4>\n<p>In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”). If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;TouchableWithoutFeedback accessibilityComponentType=”button”\n  onPress={this._onPress}&gt;\n  &lt;View style={styles.button}&gt;\n    &lt;Text style={styles.buttonText}&gt;Press me!&lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/View&gt;\n&lt;/TouchableWithoutFeedback&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example, the TouchableWithoutFeedback is being announced by TalkBack as a native Button.</p>\n<h4 id=\"accessibilityliveregion-android\">\naccessibilityLiveRegion (Android) </h4>\n<p>When components dynamically change, we want TalkBack to alert the end user. This is made possible by the ‘accessibilityLiveRegion’ property. It can be set to ‘none’, ‘polite’ and ‘assertive’:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>none</strong> Accessibility services should not announce changes to this view.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>polite</strong> Accessibility services should announce changes to this view.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>assertive</strong> Accessibility services should interrupt ongoing speech to immediately announce changes to this view.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={this._addOne}&gt;\n  &lt;View style={styles.embedded}&gt;\n    &lt;Text&gt;Click me&lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/View&gt;\n&lt;/TouchableWithoutFeedback&gt;\n&lt;Text accessibilityLiveRegion=\"polite\"&gt;\n  Clicked {this.state.count} times\n&lt;/Text&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example method _addOne changes the state.count variable. As soon as an end user clicks the TouchableWithoutFeedback, TalkBack reads text in the Text view because of its 'accessibilityLiveRegion=”polite”' property.</p>\n<h4 id=\"importantforaccessibility-android\">\nimportantForAccessibility (Android) </h4>\n<p>In the case of two overlapping UI components with the same parent, default accessibility focus can have unpredictable behavior. The ‘importantForAccessibility’ property will resolve this by controlling if a view fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services. It can be set to ‘auto’, ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘no-hide-descendants’ (the last value will force accessibility services to ignore the component and all of its children).</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\n  &lt;View style={{position: 'absolute', left: 10, top: 10, right: 10, height: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'green'}} importantForAccessibility=”yes”&gt;\n    &lt;Text&gt; First layout &lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/View&gt;\n  &lt;View style={{position: 'absolute', left: 10, top: 10, right: 10, height: 100,\n    backgroundColor: 'yellow'}} importantForAccessibility=”no-hide-descendant”&gt;\n    &lt;Text&gt; Second layout &lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/View&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example, the yellow layout and its descendants are completely invisible to TalkBack and all other accessibility services. So we can easily use overlapping views with the same parent without confusing TalkBack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sending-accessibility-events-android\">\nSending Accessibility Events (Android) </h3>\n<p>Sometimes it is useful to trigger an accessibility event on a UI component (i.e. when a custom view appears on a screen or a custom radio button has been selected). Native UIManager module exposes a method ‘sendAccessibilityEvent’ for this purpose. It takes two arguments: view tag and a type of an event.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">_onPress: function() {\n  this.state.radioButton = this.state.radioButton === “radiobutton_checked” ?\n  “radiobutton_unchecked” : “radiobutton_checked”;\n  if (this.state.radioButton === “radiobutton_checked”) {\n    RCTUIManager.sendAccessibilityEvent(\n      ReactNative.findNodeHandle(this),\n      RCTUIManager.AccessibilityEventTypes.typeViewClicked);\n  }\n}\n\n&lt;CustomRadioButton\n  accessibleComponentType={this.state.radioButton}\n  onPress={this._onPress}/&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example we've created a custom radio button that now behaves like a native one. More specifically, TalkBack now correctly announces changes to the radio button selection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-voiceover-support-ios\">\nTesting VoiceOver Support (iOS) </h2>\n<p>To enable VoiceOver, go to the Settings app on your iOS device. Tap General, then Accessibility. There you will find many tools that people use to use to make their devices more usable, such as bolder text, increased contrast, and VoiceOver.</p>\n<p>To enable VoiceOver, tap on VoiceOver under \"Vision\" and toggle the switch that appears at the top.</p>\n<p>At the very bottom of the Accessibility settings, there is an \"Accessibility Shortcut\". You can use this to toggle VoiceOver by triple clicking the Home button.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Accessibility.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

Note that if you call <code>setImmediate</code> within a <code>setImmediate</code> callback, it will be executed right away, it won't yield back to native in between.</p>\n<p>The <code>Promise</code> implementation uses <code>setImmediate</code> as its asynchronicity primitive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interactionmanager\">\nInteractionManager </h2>\n<p>One reason why well-built native apps feel so smooth is by avoiding expensive operations during interactions and animations. In React Native, we currently have a limitation that there is only a single JS execution thread, but you can use <code>InteractionManager</code> to make sure long-running work is scheduled to start after any interactions/animations have completed.</p>\n<p>Applications can schedule tasks to run after interactions with the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() =&gt; {\n   // ...long-running synchronous task...\n});</pre>\n<p>Compare this to other scheduling alternatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>requestAnimationFrame(): for code that animates a view over time.</li>\n<li>setImmediate/setTimeout/setInterval(): run code later, note this may delay animations.</li>\n<li>runAfterInteractions(): run code later, without delaying active animations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The touch handling system considers one or more active touches to be an 'interaction' and will delay <code>runAfterInteractions()</code> callbacks until all touches have ended or been cancelled.</p>\n<p>InteractionManager also allows applications to register animations by creating an interaction 'handle' on animation start, and clearing it upon completion:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">var handle = InteractionManager.createInteractionHandle();\n// run animation... (`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)\n// later, on animation completion:\nInteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);\n// queued tasks run if all handles were cleared</pre>\n<h2 id=\"timermixin\">\nTimerMixin </h2>\n<p>We found out that the primary cause of fatals in apps created with React Native was due to timers firing after a component was unmounted. To solve this recurring issue, we introduced <code>TimerMixin</code>. If you include <code>TimerMixin</code>, then you can replace your calls to <code>setTimeout(fn, 500)</code> with <code>this.setTimeout(fn, 500)</code> (just prepend <code>this.</code>) and everything will be properly cleaned up for you when the component unmounts.</p>\n<p>This library does not ship with React Native - in order to use it on your project, you will need to install it with <code>npm i react-timer-mixin --save</code> from your project directory.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import TimerMixin from 'react-timer-mixin';\n\nvar Component = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [TimerMixin],\n  componentDidMount: function() {\n    this.setTimeout(\n      () =&gt; { console.log('I do not leak!'); },\n      500\n    );\n  }\n});</pre>\n<p>This will eliminate a lot of hard work tracking down bugs, such as crashes caused by timeouts firing after a component has been unmounted.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if you use ES6 classes for your React components <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#mixins\">there is no built-in API for mixins</a>.

Scenarios may arise where it makes sense for the code to be different, for example you may want to implement separate visual components for iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>React Native provides two ways to easily organize your code and separate it by platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the <a href=\"#platform-module\"><code>Platform</code> module</a>.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"#platform-specific-extensions\">platform-specific file extensions</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain components may have properties that work on one platform only. All of these props are annotated with <code>@platform</code> and have a small badge next to them on the website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platform-module\">\nPlatform module </h2>\n<p>React Native provides a module that detects the platform in which the app is running. You can use the detection logic to implement platform-specific code. Use this option when only small parts of a component are platform-specific.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  height: (Platform.OS === 'ios') ? 200 : 100,\n});</pre>\n<p><code>Platform.OS</code> will be <code>ios</code> when running on iOS and <code>android</code> when running on Android.</p>\n<p>There is also a <code>Platform.select</code> method available, that given an object containing Platform.OS as keys, returns the value for the platform you are currently running on.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    ...Platform.select({\n      ios: {\n        backgroundColor: 'red',\n      },\n      android: {\n        backgroundColor: 'blue',\n      },\n    }),\n  },\n});</pre>\n<p>This will result in a container having <code>flex: 1</code> on both platforms, a red background color on iOS, and a blue background color on Android.</p>\n<p>Since it accepts <code>any</code> value, you can also use it to return platform specific component, like below:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">const Component = Platform.select({\n  ios: () =&gt; require('ComponentIOS'),\n  android: () =&gt; require('ComponentAndroid'),\n})();\n\n&lt;Component /&gt;;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"detecting-the-android-version\">\nDetecting the Android version </h3>\n<p>On Android, the <code>Platform</code> module can also be used to detect the version of the Android Platform in which the app is running:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { Platform } from 'react-native';\n\nif(Platform.Version === 21){\n  console.log('Running on Lollipop!');\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"platform-specific-extensions\">\nPlatform-specific extensions </h2>\n<p>When your platform-specific code is more complex, you should consider splitting the code out into separate files. React Native will detect when a file has a <code>.ios.</code> or <code>.android.</code> extension and load the relevant platform file when required from other components.</p>\n<p>For example, say you have the following files in your project:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">BigButton.ios.js\nBigButton.android.js</pre>\n<p>You can then require the component as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">const BigButton = require('./BigButton');</pre>\n<p>React Native will automatically pick up the right file based on the running platform.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/PlatformSpecificInformation.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

These creation parameters are called <code>props</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, one basic React Native component is the <code>Image</code>. When you create an image, you can use a prop named <code>source</code> to control what image it shows.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Image } from 'react-native';\n\nclass Bananas extends Component {\n  render() {\n    let pic = {\n      uri: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg'\n    };\n    return (\n      &lt;Image source={pic} style={{width: 193, height: 110}}/&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('Bananas', () =&gt; Bananas);</pre>\n<p>Notice that <code>{pic}</code> is surrounded by braces, to embed the variable <code>pic</code> into JSX. You can put any JavaScript expression inside braces in JSX.</p>\n<p>Your own components can also use <code>props</code>. This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place. Just refer to <code>this.props</code> in your <code>render</code> function. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Text&gt;Hello {this.props.name}!&lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass LotsOfGreetings extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={{alignItems: 'center'}}&gt;\n        &lt;Greeting name='Rexxar' /&gt;\n        &lt;Greeting name='Jaina' /&gt;\n        &lt;Greeting name='Valeera' /&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('LotsOfGreetings', () =&gt; LotsOfGreetings);</pre>\n<p>Using <code>name</code> as a prop lets us customize the <code>Greeting</code> component, so we can reuse that component for each of our greetings. This example also uses the <code>Greeting</code> component in JSX, just like the built-in components. The power to do this is what makes React so cool - if you find yourself wishing that you had a different set of UI primitives to work with, you just invent new ones.</p>\n<p>The other new thing going on here is the <a href=\"view\"><code>View</code></a> component. A <a href=\"view\"><code>View</code></a> is useful as a container for other components, to help control style and layout.</p>\n<p>With <code>props</code> and the basic <a href=\"text\"><code>Text</code></a>, <a href=\"image\"><code>Image</code></a>, and <a href=\"view\"><code>View</code></a> components, you can build a wide variety of static screens. To learn how to make your app change over time, you need to <a href=\"state\">learn about State</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Props.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

A touch can go through several phases as the app determines what the user's intention is. For example, the app needs to determine if the touch is scrolling, sliding on a widget, or tapping. This can even change during the duration of a touch. There can also be multiple simultaneous touches.</p>\n<p>The touch responder system is needed to allow components to negotiate these touch interactions without any additional knowledge about their parent or child components. This system is implemented in <code>ResponderEventPlugin.js</code>, which contains further details and documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"best-practices\">\nBest Practices </h3>\n<p>Users can feel huge differences in the usability of web apps vs. native, and this is one of the big causes. Every action should have the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feedback/highlighting- show the user what is handling their touch, and what will happen when they release the gesture</li>\n<li>Cancel-ability- when making an action, the user should be able to abort it mid-touch by dragging their finger away</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features make users more comfortable while using an app, because it allows people to experiment and interact without fear of making mistakes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"touchablehighlight-and-touchable\">\nTouchableHighlight and Touchable* </h3>\n<p>The responder system can be complicated to use. So we have provided an abstract <code>Touchable</code> implementation for things that should be \"tappable\". This uses the responder system and allows you to easily configure tap interactions declaratively. Use <code>TouchableHighlight</code> anywhere where you would use a button or link on web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"responder-lifecycle\">\nResponder Lifecycle </h2>\n<p>A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods. There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onStartShouldSetResponder: (evt) =&gt; true,</code> - Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?</li>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponder: (evt) =&gt; true,</code> - Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onResponderGrant: (evt) =&gt; {}</code> - The View is now responding for touch events. This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening</li>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onResponderReject: (evt) =&gt; {}</code> - Something else is the responder right now and will not release it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onResponderMove: (evt) =&gt; {}</code> - The user is moving their finger</li>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onResponderRelease: (evt) =&gt; {}</code> - Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"</li>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onResponderTerminationRequest: (evt) =&gt; true</code> - Something else wants to become responder. Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release</li>\n<li>\n<code>View.props.onResponderTerminate: (evt) =&gt; {}</code> - The responder has been taken from the View. Might be taken by other views after a call to <code>onResponderTerminationRequest</code>, or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>evt</code> is a synthetic touch event with the following form:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<code>nativeEvent</code><ul>\n<li>\n<code>changedTouches</code> - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event</li>\n<li>\n<code>identifier</code> - The ID of the touch</li>\n<li>\n<code>locationX</code> - The X position of the touch, relative to the element</li>\n<li>\n<code>locationY</code> - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element</li>\n<li>\n<code>pageX</code> - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element</li>\n<li>\n<code>pageY</code> - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element</li>\n<li>\n<code>target</code> - The node id of the element receiving the touch event</li>\n<li>\n<code>timestamp</code> - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation</li>\n<li>\n<code>touches</code> - Array of all current touches on the screen</li>\n</ul>\n</li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"capture-shouldset-handlers\">\nCapture ShouldSet Handlers </h3>\n<p><code>onStartShouldSetResponder</code> and <code>onMoveShouldSetResponder</code> are called with a bubbling pattern, where the deepest node is called first. That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for <code>*ShouldSetResponder</code> handlers. This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder. This can be handled by using the capture phase. Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component, it will do a capture phase, firing <code>on*ShouldSetResponderCapture</code>. So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start, it should have a <code>onStartShouldSetResponderCapture</code> handler which returns true.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>View.props.onStartShouldSetResponderCapture: (evt) =&gt; true,</code></li>\n<li><code>View.props.onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture: (evt) =&gt; true,</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"panresponder\">\nPanResponder </h3>\n<p>For higher-level gesture interpretation, check out <a href=\"panresponder\">PanResponder</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/GestureResponderSystem.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

To add a static image to your app, place it somewhere in your source code tree and reference it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} /&gt;</pre>\n<p>The image name is resolved the same way JS modules are resolved. In the example above the packager will look for <code>my-icon.png</code> in the same folder as the component that requires it. Also if you have <code>my-icon.ios.png</code> and <code>my-icon.android.png</code>, the packager will pick the file depending on the platform you are running on.</p>\n<p>You can also use <code>@2x</code>, <code>@3x</code>, etc. suffix in the file name to provide images for different screen densities. For example, if you have the following file structure:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">.\n├── button.js\n└── img\n    ├── check@2x.png\n    └── check@3x.png</pre>\n<p>And <code>button.js</code> code contains</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Image source={require('./img/check.png')} /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Packager will bundle and serve the image corresponding to device's screen density, e.g. on iPhone 5s <code>check@2x.png</code> will be used, on Nexus 5 – <code>check@3x.png</code>.

If you've generated your project with 0.13 or earlier, read this. The new asset system relies on build hooks for <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/3523\">Xcode</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/9dc036d2b99e6233297c55a3490bfc308e34e75f\">Gradle</a> that are included in new projects generated with <code>react-native init</code>. If you generated your projects before that, you'll have to manually add them to your projects to use the new images asset system. See <a href=\"upgrading\">Upgrading</a> for instructions on how to do this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"images-from-hybrid-app-s-resources\">\nImages From Hybrid App's Resources </h2>\n<p>If you are building a hybrid app (some UIs in React Native, some UIs in platform code) you can still use images that are already bundled into the app (via Xcode asset catalogs or Android drawable folder):</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Image source={{uri: 'app_icon'}} style={{width: 40, height: 40}} /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Note that this approach provides no safety checks. It's up to you to guarantee that those images are available in the application. Also you have to specify image dimensions manually.</p>\n<h2 id=\"network-images\">\nNetwork Images </h2>\n<p>Many of the images you will display in your app will not be available at compile time, or you will want to load some dynamically to keep the binary size down. Unlike with static resources, <em>you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image.</em></p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// GOOD\n&lt;Image source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}}\n       style={{width: 400, height: 400}} /&gt;\n\n// BAD\n&lt;Image source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} /&gt;</pre>\n<h2 id=\"local-filesystem-images\">\nLocal Filesystem Images </h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"cameraroll\">CameraRoll</a> for an example of using local resources that are outside of <code>Images.xcassets</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"best-camera-roll-image\">\nBest Camera Roll Image </h3>\n<p>iOS saves multiple sizes for the same image in your Camera Roll, it is very important to pick the one that's as close as possible for performance reasons. You wouldn't want to use the full quality 3264x2448 image as source when displaying a 200x200 thumbnail. If there's an exact match, React Native will pick it, otherwise it's going to use the first one that's at least 50% bigger in order to avoid blur when resizing from a close size. All of this is done by default so you don't have to worry about writing the tedious (and error prone) code to do it yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-automatically-size-everything\">\nWhy Not Automatically Size Everything? </h2>\n<p><em>In the browser</em> if you don't give a size to an image, the browser is going to render a 0x0 element, download the image, and then render the image based with the correct size. The big issue with this behavior is that your UI is going to jump all around as images load, this makes for a very bad user experience.</p>\n<p><em>In React Native</em> this behavior is intentionally not implemented. It is more work for the developer to know the dimensions (or aspect ratio) of the remote image in advance, but we believe that it leads to a better user experience. Static images loaded from the app bundle via the <code>require('./my-icon.png')</code> syntax <em>can be automatically sized</em> because their dimensions are available immediately at the time of mounting.</p>\n<p>For example, the result of <code>require('./my-icon.png')</code> might be:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">{\"__packager_asset\":true,\"path\":\"/Users/react/HelloWorld/my-icon.png\",\"uri\":\"my-icon.png\",\"width\":591,\"height\":573}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"source-as-an-object\">\nSource as an object </h2>\n<p>In React Native, one interesting decision is that the <code>src</code> attribute is named <code>source</code> and doesn't take a string but an object with a <code>uri</code> attribute.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Image source={{uri: 'something.jpg'}} /&gt;</pre>\n<p>On the infrastructure side, the reason is that it allows us to attach metadata to this object. For example if you are using <code>require('./my-icon.png')</code>, then we add information about its actual location and size (don't rely on this fact, it might change in the future!). This is also future proofing, for example we may want to support sprites at some point, instead of outputting <code>{uri: ...}</code>, we can output <code>{uri: ..., crop: {left: 10, top: 50, width: 20, height: 40}}</code> and transparently support spriting on all the existing call sites.</p>\n<p>On the user side, this lets you annotate the object with useful attributes such as the dimension of the image in order to compute the size it's going to be displayed in. Feel free to use it as your data structure to store more information about your image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background-image-via-nesting\">\nBackground Image via Nesting </h2>\n<p>A common feature request from developers familiar with the web is <code>background-image</code>. To handle this use case, simply create a normal <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> component and add whatever children to it you would like to layer on top of it.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">return (\n  &lt;Image source={...}&gt;\n    &lt;Text&gt;Inside&lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/Image&gt;\n);</pre>\n<h2 id=\"off-thread-decoding\">\nOff-thread Decoding </h2>\n<p>Image decoding can take more than a frame-worth of time. This is one of the major source of frame drops on the web because decoding is done in the main thread. In React Native, image decoding is done in a different thread. In practice, you already need to handle the case when the image is not downloaded yet, so displaying the placeholder for a few more frames while it is decoding does not require any code change.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Images.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions.</p>\n<p>We designed React Native such that it is possible for you to write real native code and have access to the full power of the platform. This is a more advanced feature and we don't expect it to be part of the usual development process, however it is essential that it exists. If React Native doesn't support a native feature that you need, you should be able to build it yourself.</p>\n<p>This is a more advanced guide that shows how to build a native module. It assumes the reader knows Objective-C or Swift and core libraries (Foundation, UIKit).</p>\n<h2 id=\"ios-calendar-module-example\">\niOS Calendar Module Example </h2>\n<p>This guide will use the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/EventKitProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html\">iOS Calendar API</a> example. Let's say we would like to be able to access the iOS calendar from JavaScript.</p>\n<p>A native module is just an Objective-C class that implements the <code>RCTBridgeModule</code> protocol. If you are wondering, RCT is an abbreviation of ReaCT.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// CalendarManager.h\n#import \"RCTBridgeModule.h\"\n\n@interface CalendarManager : NSObject &lt;RCTBridgeModule&gt;\n@end</pre>\n<p>In addition to implementing the <code>RCTBridgeModule</code> protocol, your class must also include the <code>RCT_EXPORT_MODULE()</code> macro. This takes an optional argument that specifies the name that the module will be accessible as in your JavaScript code (more on this later). If you do not specify a name, the JavaScript module name will match the Objective-C class name.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// CalendarManager.m\n@implementation CalendarManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE();\n\n@end</pre>\n<p>React Native will not expose any methods of <code>CalendarManager</code> to JavaScript unless explicitly told to. This is done using the <code>RCT_EXPORT_METHOD()</code> macro:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location)\n{\n  RCTLogInfo(@\"Pretending to create an event %@ at %@\", name, location);\n}</pre>\n<p>Now, from your JavaScript file you can call the method like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';\nvar CalendarManager = NativeModules.CalendarManager;\nCalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey');</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: JavaScript method names</p>\n<p>The name of the method exported to JavaScript is the native method's name up to the first colon. React Native also defines a macro called <code>RCT_REMAP_METHOD()</code> to specify the JavaScript method's name. This is useful when multiple native methods are the same up to the first colon and would have conflicting JavaScript names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The CalendarManager module is instantiated on the Objective-C side using a [CalendarManager new] call. The return type of bridge methods is always <code>void</code>. React Native bridge is asynchronous, so the only way to pass a result to JavaScript is by using callbacks or emitting events (see below).</p>\n<h2 id=\"argument-types\">\nArgument Types </h2>\n<p><code>RCT_EXPORT_METHOD</code> supports all standard JSON object types, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>string (<code>NSString</code>)</li>\n<li>number (<code>NSInteger</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>CGFloat</code>, <code>NSNumber</code>)</li>\n<li>boolean (<code>BOOL</code>, <code>NSNumber</code>)</li>\n<li>array (<code>NSArray</code>) of any types from this list</li>\n<li>object (<code>NSDictionary</code>) with string keys and values of any type from this list</li>\n<li>function (<code>RCTResponseSenderBlock</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But it also works with any type that is supported by the <code>RCTConvert</code> class (see <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Base/RCTConvert.h\"><code>RCTConvert</code></a> for details). The <code>RCTConvert</code> helper functions all accept a JSON value as input and map it to a native Objective-C type or class.</p>\n<p>In our <code>CalendarManager</code> example, we need to pass the event date to the native method. We can't send JavaScript Date objects over the bridge, so we need to convert the date to a string or number. We could write our native function like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(NSNumber *)secondsSinceUnixEpoch)\n{\n  NSDate *date = [RCTConvert NSDate:secondsSinceUnixEpoch];\n}</pre>\n<p>or like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(NSString *)ISO8601DateString)\n{\n  NSDate *date = [RCTConvert NSDate:ISO8601DateString];\n}</pre>\n<p>But by using the automatic type conversion feature, we can skip the manual conversion step completely, and just write:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(NSDate *)date)\n{\n  // Date is ready to use!\n}</pre>\n<p>You would then call this from JavaScript by using either:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">CalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey', date.getTime()); // passing date as number of seconds since Unix epoch</pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">CalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey', date.toISOString()); // passing date as ISO-8601 string</pre>\n<p>And both values would get converted correctly to the native <code>NSDate</code>. A bad value, like an <code>Array</code>, would generate a helpful \"RedBox\" error message.</p>\n<p>As <code>CalendarManager.addEvent</code> method gets more and more complex, the number of arguments will grow. Some of them might be optional. In this case it's worth considering changing the API a little bit to accept a dictionary of event attributes, like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">#import \"RCTConvert.h\"\n\nRCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name details:(NSDictionary *)details)\n{\n  NSString *location = [RCTConvert NSString:details[@\"location\"]];\n  NSDate *time = [RCTConvert NSDate:details[@\"time\"]];\n  ...\n}</pre>\n<p>and call it from JavaScript:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">CalendarManager.addEvent('Birthday Party', {\n  location: '4 Privet Drive, Surrey',\n  time: date.getTime(),\n  description: '...'\n})</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: About array and map</p>\n<p>Objective-C doesn't provide any guarantees about the types of values in these structures. Your native module might expect an array of strings, but if JavaScript calls your method with an array containing numbers and strings, you'll get an <code>NSArray</code> containing a mix of <code>NSNumber</code> and <code>NSString</code>. For arrays, <code>RCTConvert</code> provides some typed collections you can use in your method declaration, such as <code>NSStringArray</code>, or <code>UIColorArray</code>. For maps, it is the developer's responsibility to check the value types individually by manually calling <code>RCTConvert</code> helper methods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"callbacks\">\nCallbacks </h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>\n<p>This section is more experimental than others because we don't have a solid set of best practices around callbacks yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Native modules also supports a special kind of argument- a callback. In most cases it is used to provide the function call result to JavaScript.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(findEvents:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)\n{\n  NSArray *events = ...\n  callback(@[[NSNull null], events]);\n}</pre>\n<p><code>RCTResponseSenderBlock</code> accepts only one argument - an array of parameters to pass to the JavaScript callback. In this case we use node's convention to make the first parameter an error object (usually <code>null</code> when there is no error) and the rest are the results of the function.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">CalendarManager.findEvents((error, events) =&gt; {\n  if (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  } else {\n    this.setState({events: events});\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>A native module is supposed to invoke its callback only once. It can, however, store the callback and invoke it later. This pattern is often used to wrap iOS APIs that require delegates. See <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Modules/RCTAlertManager.m\"><code>RCTAlertManager</code></a> for an example.</p>\n<p>If you want to pass error-like objects to JavaScript, use <code>RCTMakeError</code> from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Base/RCTUtils.h\"><code>RCTUtils.h</code></a>. Right now this just passes an Error-shaped dictionary to JavaScript, but we would like to automatically generate real JavaScript <code>Error</code> objects in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"promises\">\nPromises </h2>\n<p>Native modules can also fulfill a promise, which can simplify your code, especially when using ES2016's <code>async/await</code> syntax. When the last parameters of a bridged native method are an <code>RCTPromiseResolveBlock</code> and <code>RCTPromiseRejectBlock</code>, its corresponding JS method will return a JS Promise object.</p>\n<p>Refactoring the above code to use a promise instead of callbacks looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_REMAP_METHOD(findEvents,\n                 resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve\n                 rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)\n{\n  NSArray *events = ...\n  if (events) {\n    resolve(events);\n  } else {\n    NSError *error = ...\n    reject(@\"no_events\", @\"There were no events\", error);\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The JavaScript counterpart of this method returns a Promise. This means you can use the <code>await</code> keyword within an async function to call it and wait for its result:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">async function updateEvents() {\n  try {\n    var events = await CalendarManager.findEvents();\n\n    this.setState({ events });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(e);\n  }\n}\n\nupdateEvents();</pre>\n<h2 id=\"threading\">\nThreading </h2>\n<p>The native module should not have any assumptions about what thread it is being called on. React Native invokes native modules methods on a separate serial GCD queue, but this is an implementation detail and might change. The <code>- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue</code> method allows the native module to specify which queue its methods should be run on. For example, if it needs to use a main-thread-only iOS API, it should specify this via:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue\n{\n  return dispatch_get_main_queue();\n}</pre>\n<p>Similarly, if an operation may take a long time to complete, the native module should not block and can specify it's own queue to run operations on. For example, the <code>RCTAsyncLocalStorage</code> module creates it's own queue so the React queue isn't blocked waiting on potentially slow disk access:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">- (dispatch_queue_t)methodQueue\n{\n  return dispatch_queue_create(\"com.facebook.React.AsyncLocalStorageQueue\", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL);\n}</pre>\n<p>The specified <code>methodQueue</code> will be shared by all of the methods in your module. If <em>just one</em> of your methods is long-running (or needs to be run on a different queue than the others for some reason), you can use <code>dispatch_async</code> inside the method to perform that particular method's code on another queue, without affecting the others:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(doSomethingExpensive:(NSString *)param callback:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)\n{\n  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{\n    // Call long-running code on background thread\n    ...\n    // You can invoke callback from any thread/queue\n    callback(@[...]);\n  });\n}</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Sharing dispatch queues between modules</p>\n<p>The <code>methodQueue</code> method will be called once when the module is initialized, and then retained by the bridge, so there is no need to retain the queue yourself, unless you wish to make use of it within your module. However, if you wish to share the same queue between multiple modules then you will need to ensure that you retain and return the same queue instance for each of them; merely returning a queue of the same name for each won't work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"exporting-constants\">\nExporting Constants </h2>\n<p>A native module can export constants that are immediately available to JavaScript at runtime. This is useful for communicating static data that would otherwise require a round-trip through the bridge.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport\n{\n  return @{ @\"firstDayOfTheWeek\": @\"Monday\" };\n}</pre>\n<p>JavaScript can use this value right away, synchronously:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">console.log(CalendarManager.firstDayOfTheWeek);</pre>\n<p>Note that the constants are exported only at initialization time, so if you change <code>constantsToExport</code> values at runtime it won't affect the JavaScript environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enum-constants\">\nEnum Constants </h3>\n<p>Enums that are defined via <code>NS_ENUM</code> cannot be used as method arguments without first extending RCTConvert.</p>\n<p>In order to export the following <code>NS_ENUM</code> definition:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, UIStatusBarAnimation) {\n    UIStatusBarAnimationNone,\n    UIStatusBarAnimationFade,\n    UIStatusBarAnimationSlide,\n};</pre>\n<p>You must create a class extension of RCTConvert like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">@implementation RCTConvert (StatusBarAnimation)\n  RCT_ENUM_CONVERTER(UIStatusBarAnimation, (@{ @\"statusBarAnimationNone\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationNone),\n                                               @\"statusBarAnimationFade\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationFade),\n                                               @\"statusBarAnimationSlide\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationSlide)}),\n                      UIStatusBarAnimationNone, integerValue)\n@end</pre>\n<p>You can then define methods and export your enum constants like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport\n{\n  return @{ @\"statusBarAnimationNone\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationNone),\n            @\"statusBarAnimationFade\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationFade),\n            @\"statusBarAnimationSlide\" : @(UIStatusBarAnimationSlide) }\n};\n\nRCT_EXPORT_METHOD(updateStatusBarAnimation:(UIStatusBarAnimation)animation\n                                completion:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback)</pre>\n<p>Your enum will then be automatically unwrapped using the selector provided (<code>integerValue</code> in the above example) before being passed to your exported method.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sending-events-to-javascript\">\nSending Events to JavaScript </h2>\n<p>The native module can signal events to JavaScript without being invoked directly. The easiest way to do this is to use <code>eventDispatcher</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">#import \"RCTBridge.h\"\n#import \"RCTEventDispatcher.h\"\n\n@implementation CalendarManager\n\n@synthesize bridge = _bridge;\n\n- (void)calendarEventReminderReceived:(NSNotification *)notification\n{\n  NSString *eventName = notification.userInfo[@\"name\"];\n  [self.bridge.eventDispatcher sendAppEventWithName:@\"EventReminder\"\n                                               body:@{@\"name\": eventName}];\n}\n\n@end</pre>\n<p>JavaScript code can subscribe to these events:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { NativeAppEventEmitter } from 'react-native';\n\nvar subscription = NativeAppEventEmitter.addListener(\n  'EventReminder',\n  (reminder) =&gt; console.log(reminder.name)\n);\n...\n// Don't forget to unsubscribe, typically in componentWillUnmount\nsubscription.remove();</pre>\n<p>For more examples of sending events to JavaScript, see <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Geolocation/RCTLocationObserver.m\"><code>RCTLocationObserver</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exporting-swift\">\nExporting Swift </h2>\n<p>Swift doesn't have support for macros so exposing it to React Native requires a bit more setup but works relatively the same.</p>\n<p>Let's say we have the same <code>CalendarManager</code> but as a Swift class:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// CalendarManager.swift\n\n@objc(CalendarManager)\nclass CalendarManager: NSObject {\n\n  @objc func addEvent(name: String, location: String, date: NSNumber) -&gt; Void {\n    // Date is ready to use!\n  }\n\n}</pre>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is important to use the @objc modifiers to ensure the class and functions are exported properly to the Objective-C runtime.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then create a private implementation file that will register the required information with the React Native bridge:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// CalendarManagerBridge.m\n#import \"RCTBridgeModule.h\"\n\n@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(CalendarManager, NSObject)\n\nRCT_EXTERN_METHOD(addEvent:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location date:(nonnull NSNumber *)date)\n\n@end</pre>\n<p>For those of you new to Swift and Objective-C, whenever you <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html\">mix the two languages in an iOS project</a>, you will also need an additional bridging file, known as a bridging header, to expose the Objective-C files to Swift. Xcode will offer to create this header file for you if you add your Swift file to your app through the Xcode <code>File&gt;New File</code> menu option. You will need to import <code>RCTBridgeModule.h</code> in this header file.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// CalendarManager-Bridging-Header.h\n#import \"RCTBridgeModule.h\"</pre>\n<p>You can also use <code>RCT_EXTERN_REMAP_MODULE</code> and <code>RCT_EXTERN_REMAP_METHOD</code> to alter the JavaScript name of the module or methods you are exporting.

React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like <code>ScrollView</code> and <code>TextInput</code>, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app. Fortunately, it's quite easy to wrap up these existing components for seamless integration with your React Native application.</p>\n<p>Like the native module guide, this too is a more advanced guide that assumes you are somewhat familiar with iOS programming. This guide will show you how to build a native UI component, walking you through the implementation of a subset of the existing <code>MapView</code> component available in the core React Native library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ios-mapview-example\">\niOS MapView example </h2>\n<p>Let's say we want to add an interactive Map to our app - might as well use <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKMapView_Class/index.html\"><code>MKMapView</code></a>, we just need to make it usable from JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Native views are created and manipulated by subclasses of <code>RCTViewManager</code>. These subclasses are similar in function to view controllers, but are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge. They vend native views to the <code>RCTUIManager</code>, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary. The <code>RCTViewManager</code>s are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge.</p>\n<p>Vending a view is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create the basic subclass.</li>\n<li>Add the <code>RCT_EXPORT_MODULE()</code> marker macro.</li>\n<li>Implement the <code>-(UIView *)view</code> method.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTMapManager.m\n#import &lt;MapKit/MapKit.h&gt;\n\n#import \"RCTViewManager.h\"\n\n@interface RCTMapManager : RCTViewManager\n@end\n\n@implementation RCTMapManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE()\n\n- (UIView *)view\n{\n  return [[MKMapView alloc] init];\n}\n\n@end</pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not attempt to set the <code>frame</code> or <code>backgroundColor</code> properties on the <code>UIView</code> instance that you vend through the <code>-view</code> method. React Native will overwrite the values set by your custom class in order to match your JavaScript component's layout props. If you need this granularity of control it might be better to wrap the <code>UIView</code> instance you want to style in another <code>UIView</code> and return the wrapper <code>UIView</code> instead. See <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2948\">Issue 2948</a> for more context.</p>\n<p>Then you just need a little bit of JavaScript to make this a usable React component:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// MapView.js\n\nimport { requireNativeComponent } from 'react-native';\n\n// requireNativeComponent automatically resolves this to \"RCTMapManager\"\nmodule.exports = requireNativeComponent('RCTMap', null);</pre>\n<p>This is now a fully-functioning native map view component in JavaScript, complete with pinch-zoom and other native gesture support. We can't really control it from JavaScript yet, though :(</p>\n<h2 id=\"properties\">\nProperties </h2>\n<p>The first thing we can do to make this component more usable is to bridge over some native properties. Let's say we want to be able to disable pitch control and specify the visible region. Disabling pitch is a simple boolean, so we add this one line:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTMapManager.m\nRCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(pitchEnabled, BOOL)</pre>\n<p>Note that we explicitly specify the type as <code>BOOL</code> - React Native uses <code>RCTConvert</code> under the hood to convert all sorts of different data types when talking over the bridge, and bad values will show convenient \"RedBox\" errors to let you know there is an issue ASAP. When things are straightforward like this, the whole implementation is taken care of for you by this macro.</p>\n<p>Now to actually disable pitch, we set the property in JS:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// MyApp.js\n&lt;MapView pitchEnabled={false} /&gt;</pre>\n<p>This isn't very well documented though - in order to know what properties are available and what values they accept, the client of your new component needs to dig through the Objective-C code. To make this better, let's make a wrapper component and document the interface with React <code>PropTypes</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// MapView.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { requireNativeComponent } from 'react-native';\n\nclass MapView extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return &lt;RCTMap {...this.props} /&gt;;\n  }\n}\n\nMapView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * When this property is set to `true` and a valid camera is associated\n   * with the map, the camera’s pitch angle is used to tilt the plane\n   * of the map. When this property is set to `false`, the camera’s pitch\n   * angle is ignored and the map is always displayed as if the user\n   * is looking straight down onto it.\n   */\n  pitchEnabled: React.PropTypes.bool,\n};\n\nvar RCTMap = requireNativeComponent('RCTMap', MapView);\n\nmodule.exports = MapView;</pre>\n<p>Now we have a nicely documented wrapper component that is easy to work with. Note that we changed the second argument to <code>requireNativeComponent</code> from <code>null</code> to the new <code>MapView</code> wrapper component. This allows the infrastructure to verify that the propTypes match the native props to reduce the chances of mismatches between the ObjC and JS code.</p>\n<p>Next, let's add the more complex <code>region</code> prop. We start by adding the native code:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTMapManager.m\nRCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY(region, MKCoordinateRegion, RCTMap)\n{\n  [view setRegion:json ? [RCTConvert MKCoordinateRegion:json] : defaultView.region animated:YES];\n}</pre>\n<p>Ok, this is more complicated than the simple <code>BOOL</code> case we had before. Now we have a <code>MKCoordinateRegion</code> type that needs a conversion function, and we have custom code so that the view will animate when we set the region from JS. Within the function body that we provide, <code>json</code> refers to the raw value that has been passed from JS. There is also a <code>view</code> variable which gives us access to the manager's view instance, and a <code>defaultView</code> that we use to reset the property back to the default value if JS sends us a null sentinel.</p>\n<p>You could write any conversion function you want for your view - here is the implementation for <code>MKCoordinateRegion</code> via two categories on <code>RCTConvert</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">@implementation RCTConvert(CoreLocation)\n\nRCT_CONVERTER(CLLocationDegrees, CLLocationDegrees, doubleValue);\nRCT_CONVERTER(CLLocationDistance, CLLocationDistance, doubleValue);\n\n+ (CLLocationCoordinate2D)CLLocationCoordinate2D:(id)json\n{\n  json = [self NSDictionary:json];\n  return (CLLocationCoordinate2D){\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"latitude\"]],\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"longitude\"]]\n  };\n}\n\n@end\n\n@implementation RCTConvert(MapKit)\n\n+ (MKCoordinateSpan)MKCoordinateSpan:(id)json\n{\n  json = [self NSDictionary:json];\n  return (MKCoordinateSpan){\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"latitudeDelta\"]],\n    [self CLLocationDegrees:json[@\"longitudeDelta\"]]\n  };\n}\n\n+ (MKCoordinateRegion)MKCoordinateRegion:(id)json\n{\n  return (MKCoordinateRegion){\n    [self CLLocationCoordinate2D:json],\n    [self MKCoordinateSpan:json]\n  };\n}</pre>\n<p>These conversion functions are designed to safely process any JSON that the JS might throw at them by displaying \"RedBox\" errors and returning standard initialization values when missing keys or other developer errors are encountered.</p>\n<p>To finish up support for the <code>region</code> prop, we need to document it in <code>propTypes</code> (or we'll get an error that the native prop is undocumented), then we can set it just like any other prop:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// MapView.js\n\nMapView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * When this property is set to `true` and a valid camera is associated\n   * with the map, the camera’s pitch angle is used to tilt the plane\n   * of the map. When this property is set to `false`, the camera’s pitch\n   * angle is ignored and the map is always displayed as if the user\n   * is looking straight down onto it.\n   */\n  pitchEnabled: React.PropTypes.bool,\n\n  /**\n   * The region to be displayed by the map.\n   *\n   * The region is defined by the center coordinates and the span of\n   * coordinates to display.\n   */\n  region: React.PropTypes.shape({\n    /**\n     * Coordinates for the center of the map.\n     */\n    latitude: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    longitude: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n\n    /**\n     * Distance between the minimum and the maximum latitude/longitude\n     * to be displayed.\n     */\n    latitudeDelta: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    longitudeDelta: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n  }),\n};\n\n// MyApp.js\n\n  render() {\n    var region = {\n      latitude: 37.48,\n      longitude: -122.16,\n      latitudeDelta: 0.1,\n      longitudeDelta: 0.1,\n    };\n    return &lt;MapView region={region} /&gt;;\n  }</pre>\n<p>Here you can see that the shape of the region is explicit in the JS documentation - ideally we could codegen some of this stuff, but that's not happening yet.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you'll have some special properties that you need to expose for the native component, but don't actually want them as part of the API for the associated React component. For example, <code>Switch</code> has a custom <code>onChange</code> handler for the raw native event, and exposes an <code>onValueChange</code> handler property that is invoked with just the boolean value rather than the raw event. Since you don't want these native only properties to be part of the API, you don't want to put them in <code>propTypes</code>, but if you don't you'll get an error. The solution is simply to call them out via the <code>nativeOnly</code> option, e.g.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">var RCTSwitch = requireNativeComponent('RCTSwitch', Switch, {\n  nativeOnly: { onChange: true }\n});</pre>\n<h2 id=\"events\">\nEvents </h2>\n<p>So now we have a native map component that we can control easily from JS, but how do we deal with events from the user, like pinch-zooms or panning to change the visible region? The key is to declare an event handler property on <code>RCTMapManager</code>, make it a delegate for all the views it vends, and forward events to JS by calling the event handler block from the native view. This looks like so (simplified from the full implementation):</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTMap.h\n\n#import &lt;MapKit/MapKit.h&gt;\n\n#import \"RCTComponent.h\"\n\n@interface RCTMap: MKMapView\n\n@property (nonatomic, copy) RCTBubblingEventBlock onChange;\n\n@end</pre>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTMap.m\n\n#import \"RCTMap.h\"\n\n@implementation RCTMap\n\n@end</pre>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTMapManager.m\n\n#import \"RCTMapManager.h\"\n\n#import &lt;MapKit/MapKit.h&gt;\n\n#import \"RCTMap.h\"\n#import \"UIView+React.h\"\n\n@interface RCTMapManager() &lt;MKMapViewDelegate&gt;\n@end\n\n@implementation RCTMapManager\n\nRCT_EXPORT_MODULE()\n\nRCT_EXPORT_VIEW_PROPERTY(onChange, RCTBubblingEventBlock)\n\n- (UIView *)view\n{\n  RCTMap *map = [RCTMap new];\n  map.delegate = self;\n  return map;\n}\n\n#pragma mark MKMapViewDelegate\n\n- (void)mapView:(RCTMap *)mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated\n{\n  if (!mapView.onChange) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  MKCoordinateRegion region = mapView.region;\n  mapView.onChange(@{\n    @\"region\": @{\n      @\"latitude\": @(region.center.latitude),\n      @\"longitude\": @(region.center.longitude),\n      @\"latitudeDelta\": @(region.span.latitudeDelta),\n      @\"longitudeDelta\": @(region.span.longitudeDelta),\n    }\n  });\n}</pre>\n<p>You can see we're adding an event handler property to the view by subclassing <code>MKMapView</code>. Then we're exposing the <code>onChange</code> event handler property and setting the manager as the delegate for every view that it vends. Finally, in the delegate method <code>-mapView:regionDidChangeAnimated:</code> the event handler block is called on the corresponding view with the region data. Calling the <code>onChange</code> event handler block results in calling the same callback prop in JavaScript. This callback is invoked with the raw event, which we typically process in the wrapper component to make a simpler API:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// MapView.js\n\nclass MapView extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this._onChange = this._onChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  _onChange(event: Event) {\n    if (!this.props.onRegionChange) {\n      return;\n    }\n    this.props.onRegionChange(event.nativeEvent.region);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return &lt;RCTMap {...this.props} onChange={this._onChange} /&gt;;\n  }\n}\nMapView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * Callback that is called continuously when the user is dragging the map.\n   */\n  onRegionChange: React.PropTypes.func,\n  ...\n};</pre>\n<h2 id=\"styles\">\nStyles </h2>\n<p>Since all our native react views are subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, most style attributes will work like you would expect out of the box. Some components will want a default style, however, for example <code>UIDatePicker</code> which is a fixed size. This default style is important for the layout algorithm to work as expected, but we also want to be able to override the default style when using the component. <code>DatePickerIOS</code> does this by wrapping the native component in an extra view, which has flexible styling, and using a fixed style (which is generated with constants passed in from native) on the inner native component:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// DatePickerIOS.ios.js\n\nimport { UIManager } from 'react-native';\nvar RCTDatePickerIOSConsts = UIManager.RCTDatePicker.Constants;\n...\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={this.props.style}&gt;\n        &lt;RCTDatePickerIOS\n          ref={DATEPICKER}\n          style={styles.rkDatePickerIOS}\n          ...\n        /&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  rkDatePickerIOS: {\n    height: RCTDatePickerIOSConsts.ComponentHeight,\n    width: RCTDatePickerIOSConsts.ComponentWidth,\n  },\n});</pre>\n<p>The <code>RCTDatePickerIOSConsts</code> constants are exported from native by grabbing the actual frame of the native component like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTDatePickerManager.m\n\n- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport\n{\n  UIDatePicker *dp = [[UIDatePicker alloc] init];\n  [dp layoutIfNeeded];\n\n  return @{\n    @\"ComponentHeight\": @(CGRectGetHeight(dp.frame)),\n    @\"ComponentWidth\": @(CGRectGetWidth(dp.frame)),\n    @\"DatePickerModes\": @{\n      @\"time\": @(UIDatePickerModeTime),\n      @\"date\": @(UIDatePickerModeDate),\n      @\"datetime\": @(UIDatePickerModeDateAndTime),\n    }\n  };\n}</pre>\n<p>This guide covered many of the aspects of bridging over custom native components, but there is even more you might need to consider, such as custom hooks for inserting and laying out subviews.

React Native has several of the most critical platform components already wrapped, like <code>ScrollView</code> and <code>TextInput</code>, but not all of them, and certainly not ones you might have written yourself for a previous app. Fortunately, it's quite easy to wrap up these existing components for seamless integration with your React Native application.</p>\n<p>Like the native module guide, this too is a more advanced guide that assumes you are somewhat familiar with Android SDK programming. This guide will show you how to build a native UI component, walking you through the implementation of a subset of the existing <code>ImageView</code>component available in the core React Native library.</p>\n<h2 id=\"imageview-example\">\nImageView example </h2>\n<p>For this example we are going to walk through the implementation requirements to allow the use of ImageViews in JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Native views are created and manipulated by extending <code>ViewManager</code> or more commonly <code>SimpleViewManager</code> . A <code>SimpleViewManager</code> is convenient in this case because it applies common properties such as background color, opacity, and Flexbox layout.</p>\n<p>These subclasses are essentially singletons - only one instance of each is created by the bridge. They vend native views to the <code>NativeViewHierarchyManager</code>, which delegates back to them to set and update the properties of the views as necessary. The <code>ViewManagers</code> are also typically the delegates for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge.</p>\n<p>Vending a view is simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create the ViewManager subclass.</li>\n<li>Implement the <code>createViewInstance</code> method</li>\n<li>Expose view property setters using <code>@ReactProp</code> (or <code>@ReactPropGroup</code>) annotation</li>\n<li>Register the manager in <code>createViewManagers</code> of the applications package.</li>\n<li>Implement the JavaScript module</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"1-create-the-viewmanager-subclass\">\n1. Create the <code>ViewManager</code> subclass </h2>\n<p>In this example we create view manager class <code>ReactImageManager</code> that extends <code>SimpleViewManager</code> of type <code>ReactImageView</code>. <code>ReactImageView</code> is the type of object managed by the manager, this will be the custom native view. Name returned by <code>getName</code> is used to reference the native view type from JavaScript.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">...\n\npublic class ReactImageManager extends SimpleViewManager&lt;ReactImageView&gt; {\n\n  public static final String REACT_CLASS = \"RCTImageView\";\n\n  @Override\n  public String getName() {\n    return REACT_CLASS;\n  }</pre>\n<h2 id=\"2-implement-method-createviewinstance\">\n2. Implement method <code>createViewInstance</code> </h2>\n<p>Views are created in the <code>createViewInstance</code> method, the view should initialize itself in its default state, any properties will be set via a follow up call to <code>updateView.</code></p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">  @Override\n  public ReactImageView createViewInstance(ThemedReactContext context) {\n    return new ReactImageView(context, Fresco.newDraweeControllerBuilder(), mCallerContext);\n  }</pre>\n<h2 id=\"3-expose-view-property-setters-using-reactprop-or-reactpropgroup-annotation\">\n3. Expose view property setters using <code>@ReactProp</code> (or <code>@ReactPropGroup</code>) annotation </h2>\n<p>Properties that are to be reflected in JavaScript needs to be exposed as setter method annotated with <code>@ReactProp</code> (or <code>@ReactPropGroup</code>). Setter method should take view to be updated (of the current view type) as a first argument and property value as a second argument. Setter should be declared as a <code>void</code> method and should be <code>public</code>. Property type sent to JS is determined automatically based on the type of value argument of the setter. The following type of values are currently supported: <code>boolean</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>ReadableArray</code>, <code>ReadableMap</code>.</p>\n<p>Annotation <code>@ReactProp</code> has one obligatory argument <code>name</code> of type <code>String</code>. Name assigned to the <code>@ReactProp</code> annotation linked to the setter method is used to reference the property on JS side.</p>\n<p>Except from <code>name</code>, <code>@ReactProp</code> annotation may take following optional arguments: <code>defaultBoolean</code>, <code>defaultInt</code>, <code>defaultFloat</code>. Those arguments should be of the corresponding primitive type (accordingly <code>boolean</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>) and the value provided will be passed to the setter method in case when the property that the setter is referencing has been removed from the component. Note that \"default\" values are only provided for primitive types, in case when setter is of some complex type, <code>null</code> will be provided as a default value in case when corresponding property gets removed.</p>\n<p>Setter declaration requirements for methods annotated with <code>@ReactPropGroup</code> are different than for <code>@ReactProp</code>, please refer to the <code>@ReactPropGroup</code> annotation class docs for more information about it.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> in ReactJS updating the property value will result in setter method call. Note that one of the ways we can update component is by removing properties that has been set before. In that case setter method will be called as well to notify view manager that property has changed. In that case \"default\" value will be provided (for primitive types \"default\" can value can be specified using <code>defaultBoolean</code>, <code>defaultFloat</code>, etc. arguments of <code>@ReactProp</code> annotation, for complex types setter will be called with value set to <code>null</code>).</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">  @ReactProp(name = \"src\")\n  public void setSrc(ReactImageView view, @Nullable String src) {\n    view.setSource(src);\n  }\n\n  @ReactProp(name = \"borderRadius\", defaultFloat = 0f)\n  public void setBorderRadius(ReactImageView view, float borderRadius) {\n    view.setBorderRadius(borderRadius);\n  }\n\n  @ReactProp(name = ViewProps.RESIZE_MODE)\n  public void setResizeMode(ReactImageView view, @Nullable String resizeMode) {\n    view.setScaleType(ImageResizeMode.toScaleType(resizeMode));\n  }</pre>\n<h2 id=\"4-register-the-viewmanager\">\n4. Register the <code>ViewManager</code> </h2>\n<p>The final Java step is to register the ViewManager to the application, this happens in a similar way to <a href=\"native-modules-android\">Native Modules</a>, via the applications package member function <code>createViewManagers.</code></p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">  @Override\n  public List&lt;ViewManager&gt; createViewManagers(\n                            ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\n    return Arrays.&lt;ViewManager&gt;asList(\n      new ReactImageManager()\n    );\n  }</pre>\n<h2 id=\"5-implement-the-javascript-module\">\n5. Implement the JavaScript module </h2>\n<p>The very final step is to create the JavaScript module that defines the interface layer between Java and JavaScript for the users of your new view. Much of the effort is handled by internal React code in Java and JavaScript and all that is left for you is to describe the <code>propTypes</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// ImageView.js\n\nimport { PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { requireNativeComponent, View } from 'react-native';\n\nvar iface = {\n  name: 'ImageView',\n  propTypes: {\n    src: PropTypes.string,\n    borderRadius: PropTypes.number,\n    resizeMode: PropTypes.oneOf(['cover', 'contain', 'stretch']),\n    ...View.propTypes // include the default view properties\n  },\n};\n\nmodule.exports = requireNativeComponent('RCTImageView', iface);</pre>\n<p><code>requireNativeComponent</code> commonly takes two parameters, the first is the name of the native view and the second is an object that describes the component interface. The component interface should declare a friendly <code>name</code> for use in debug messages and must declare the <code>propTypes</code> reflected by the Native View. The <code>propTypes</code> are used for checking the validity of a user's use of the native view. Note that if you need your JavaScript component to do more than just specify a name and propTypes, like do custom event handling, you can wrap the native component in a normal react component. In that case, you want to pass in the wrapper component instead of <code>iface</code> to <code>requireNativeComponent</code>. This is illustrated in the <code>MyCustomView</code> example below.</p>\n<h1 id=\"events\">\nEvents </h1>\n<p>So now we know how to expose native view components that we can control easily from JS, but how do we deal with events from the user, like pinch-zooms or panning? When a native event occurs the native code should issue an event to the JavaScript representation of the View, and the two views are linked with the value returned from the <code>getId()</code> method.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyCustomView extends View {\n   ...\n   public void onReceiveNativeEvent() {\n      WritableMap event = Arguments.createMap();\n      event.putString(\"message\", \"MyMessage\");\n      ReactContext reactContext = (ReactContext)getContext();\n      reactContext.getJSModule(RCTEventEmitter.class).receiveEvent(\n          getId(),\n          \"topChange\",\n          event);\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p>The event name <code>topChange</code> maps to the <code>onChange</code> callback prop in JavaScript (mappings are in <code>UIManagerModuleConstants.java</code>). This callback is invoked with the raw event, which we typically process in the wrapper component to make a simpler API:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// MyCustomView.js\n\nclass MyCustomView extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this._onChange = this._onChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  _onChange(event: Event) {\n    if (!this.props.onChangeMessage) {\n      return;\n    }\n    this.props.onChangeMessage(event.nativeEvent.message);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return &lt;RCTMyCustomView {...this.props} onChange={this._onChange} /&gt;;\n  }\n}\nMyCustomView.propTypes = {\n  /**\n   * Callback that is called continuously when the user is dragging the map.\n   */\n  onChangeMessage: React.PropTypes.func,\n  ...\n};\n\nvar RCTMyCustomView = requireNativeComponent(`RCTMyCustomView`, MyCustomView, {\n  nativeOnly: {onChange: true}\n});</pre>\n<p>Note the use of <code>nativeOnly</code> above. Sometimes you'll have some special properties that you need to expose for the native component, but don't actually want them as part of the API for the associated React component. For example, <code>Switch</code> has a custom <code>onChange</code> handler for the raw native event, and exposes an <code>onValueChange</code> handler property that is invoked with just the boolean value rather than the raw event (similar to <code>onChangeMessage</code> in the example above). Since you don't want these native only properties to be part of the API, you don't want to put them in <code>propTypes</code>, but if you don't you'll get an error. The solution is simply to call them out via the <code>nativeOnly</code> option.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/NativeComponentsAndroid.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

As soon as you add a second screen to your app, you will have to take into consideration how the user will navigate from one screen to the other.</p>\n<p>You can use navigators to transition between multiple screens. These transitions can be typical side-to-side animations down a master/detail stack, or vertical modal popups.</p>\n<h2 id=\"navigator\">\nNavigator </h2>\n<p>React Native has several built-in navigation components, but for your first app you will probably want to use <code>Navigator</code>.

Together, these components make up a scene (another word for screen) in your app.</p>\n<p>A scene is nothing other than a React component that is typically rendered full screen. This is in contrast to a <code>Text</code>, an <code>Image</code>, or even a custom <code>SpinningBeachball</code> component that is meant to be rendered as part of a screen. You may have already used one without realizing it - the <a href=\"tutorial\">\"HelloWorldApp\"</a>, the <a href=\"flexbox\">\"FlexDirectionBasics\"</a>, and the <a href=\"using-a-listview\">\"ListViewBasics\"</a> components covered earlier in the tutorial are all examples of scenes.</p>\n<p>For simplicity's sake, let's define a simple scene that displays a bit of text. We will come back to this scene later as we add navigation to our app. Create a new file called \"MyScene.js\" with the following contents:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class MyScene extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    title: React.PropTypes.string,\n  };    \n  static defaultProps = {\n    title: 'MyScene',\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Hi! My name is {this.props.title}.&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Notice the <code>export default</code> in front of the component declaration. This will <em>export</em> the component, and in turn allow other components to <em>import</em> it later on, like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { View, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nimport MyScene from './MyScene';\n\nclass YoDawgApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;MyScene /&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('YoDawgApp', () =&gt; YoDawgApp);</pre>\n<p>We now have a simple app that renders your scene and nothing else. In this case, <code>MyScene</code> is a simple example of a <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html\">reusable React component</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-navigator\">\nUsing Navigator </h3>\n<p>Enough about scenes, let's start navigating. We will start by rendering a <code>Navigator</code>, and then let the <code>Navigator</code> render the scene for you by passing in your own render function to its <code>renderScene</code> prop.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">render() {\n  return (\n    &lt;Navigator\n      initialRoute={{ title: 'My Initial Scene', index: 0 }}\n      renderScene={(route, navigator) =&gt; {\n        &lt;MyScene title={route.title} /&gt;\n      }}\n    /&gt;\n  );\n}</pre>\n<p>Something you will encounter a lot when dealing with navigation is the concept of routes. A route is an object that contains information about a scene. It is used to provide all the context that the navigator's <code>renderScene</code> function needs to render a scene. It can have any number of keys to help distinguish your scene, and I happened to pick a single <code>title</code> key for the above example.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pushing-scenes-onto-the-stack\">\nPushing scenes onto the stack </h4>\n<p>In order to transition to a new scene, you will need to learn about <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>. These two methods are provided by the <code>navigator</code> object that is passed to your <code>renderScene</code> function above. They can be used, as you may have realized, to push and pop routes into your navigation stack.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">navigator.push({\n  title: 'Next Scene',\n  index: 1,\n});\n\nnavigator.pop();</pre>\n<p>A more complete example that demonstrates the pushing and popping of routes could therefore look something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport { Navigator, Text, TouchableHighlight, View } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class SimpleNavigationApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Navigator\n        initialRoute={{ title: 'My Initial Scene', index: 0 }}\n        renderScene={(route, navigator) =&gt;\n          &lt;MyScene\n            title={route.title}\n\n            // Function to call when a new scene should be displayed           \n            onForward={ () =&gt; {    \n              const nextIndex = route.index + 1;\n              navigator.push({\n                title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n                index: nextIndex,\n              });\n            }}\n\n            // Function to call to go back to the previous scene\n            onBack={() =&gt; {\n              if (route.index &gt; 0) {\n                navigator.pop();\n              }\n            }}\n          /&gt;\n        }\n      /&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyScene extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    onForward: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n    onBack: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Current Scene: { this.props.title }&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={this.props.onForward}&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Tap me to load the next scene&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={this.props.onBack}&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Tap me to go back&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>In this example, the <code>MyScene</code> component is passed the title of the current route via the <code>title</code> prop. It displays two tappable components that call the <code>onForward</code> and <code>onBack</code> functions passed through its props, which in turn will call <code>navigator.push()</code> and <code>navigator.pop()</code> as needed.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"navigator\">Navigator API reference</a> for more <code>Navigator</code> code samples, or read through the <a href=\"navigation\">Navigation guide</a> for other examples of what you can do with navigators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"high-five\">\nHigh Five! </h2>\n<p>If you've gotten here by reading linearly through the tutorial, then you are a pretty impressive human being.

When using React in the browser for example, you sometimes need to directly modify a DOM node, and the same is true for views in mobile apps. <code>setNativeProps</code> is the React Native equivalent to setting properties directly on a DOM node.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use setNativeProps when frequent re-rendering creates a performance bottleneck</p>\n<p>Direct manipulation will not be a tool that you reach for frequently; you will typically only be using it for creating continuous animations to avoid the overhead of rendering the component hierarchy and reconciling many views. <code>setNativeProps</code> is imperative and stores state in the native layer (DOM, UIView, etc.) and not within your React components, which makes your code more difficult to reason about. Before you use it, try to solve your problem with <code>setState</code> and <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html#shouldcomponentupdate-in-action\">shouldComponentUpdate</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"setnativeprops-with-touchableopacity\">\nsetNativeProps with TouchableOpacity </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Components/Touchable/TouchableOpacity.js\">TouchableOpacity</a> uses <code>setNativeProps</code> internally to update the opacity of its child component:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">setOpacityTo(value) {\n  // Redacted: animation related code\n  this.refs[CHILD_REF].setNativeProps({\n    opacity: value\n  });\n},</pre>\n<p>This allows us to write the following code and know that the child will have its opacity updated in response to taps, without the child having any knowledge of that fact or requiring any changes to its implementation:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={this._handlePress}&gt;\n  &lt;View style={styles.button}&gt;\n    &lt;Text&gt;Press me!&lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;/View&gt;\n&lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;</pre>\n<p>Let's imagine that <code>setNativeProps</code> was not available. One way that we might implement it with that constraint is to store the opacity value in the state, then update that value whenever <code>onPress</code> is fired:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">constructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = { myButtonOpacity: 1, };\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    &lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={() =&gt; this.setState({myButtonOpacity: 0.5})}\n                      onPressOut={() =&gt; this.setState({myButtonOpacity: 1})}&gt;\n      &lt;View style={[styles.button, {opacity: this.state.myButtonOpacity}]}&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Press me!&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>This is computationally intensive compared to the original example - React needs to re-render the component hierarchy each time the opacity changes, even though other properties of the view and its children haven't changed. Usually this overhead isn't a concern but when performing continuous animations and responding to gestures, judiciously optimizing your components can improve your animations' fidelity.</p>\n<p>If you look at the implementation of <code>setNativeProps</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/native/NativeMethodsMixin.js\">NativeMethodsMixin.js</a> you will notice that it is a wrapper around <code>RCTUIManager.updateView</code> - this is the exact same function call that results from re-rendering - see <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/native/ReactNativeBaseComponent.js\">receiveComponent in ReactNativeBaseComponent.js</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"composite-components-and-setnativeprops\">\nComposite components and setNativeProps </h2>\n<p>Composite components are not backed by a native view, so you cannot call <code>setNativeProps</code> on them. Consider this example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyButton extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;{this.props.label}&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;TouchableOpacity&gt;\n        &lt;MyButton label=\"Press me!\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://rnplay.org/apps/JXkgmQ\">Run this example</a></p>\n<p>If you run this you will immediately see this error: <code>Touchable child\nmust either be native or forward setNativeProps to a native component</code>. This occurs because <code>MyButton</code> isn't directly backed by a native view whose opacity should be set. You can think about it like this: if you define a component with <code>React.createClass</code> you would not expect to be able to set a style prop on it and have that work - you would need to pass the style prop down to a child, unless you are wrapping a native component. Similarly, we are going to forward <code>setNativeProps</code> to a native-backed child component.</p>\n<h4 id=\"forward-setnativeprops-to-a-child\">\nForward setNativeProps to a child </h4>\n<p>All we need to do is provide a <code>setNativeProps</code> method on our component that calls <code>setNativeProps</code> on the appropriate child with the given arguments.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyButton extends React.Component {\n  setNativeProps(nativeProps) {\n    this._root.setNativeProps(nativeProps);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View ref={component =&gt; this._root = component} {...this.props}&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;{this.props.label}&lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://rnplay.org/apps/YJxnEQ\">Run this example</a></p>\n<p>You can now use <code>MyButton</code> inside of <code>TouchableOpacity</code>! A sidenote for clarity: we used the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute\">ref callback</a> syntax here, rather than the traditional string-based ref.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that we passed all of the props down to the child view using <code>{...this.props}</code>. The reason for this is that <code>TouchableOpacity</code> is actually a composite component, and so in addition to depending on <code>setNativeProps</code> on its child, it also requires that the child perform touch handling. To do this, it passes on <a href=\"view#onmoveshouldsetresponder\">various props</a> that call back to the <code>TouchableOpacity</code> component. <code>TouchableHighlight</code>, in contrast, is backed by a native view and only requires that we implement <code>setNativeProps</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setnativeprops-to-clear-textinput-value\">\nsetNativeProps to clear TextInput value </h2>\n<p>Another very common use case of <code>setNativeProps</code> is to clear the value of a TextInput. The <code>controlled</code> prop of TextInput can sometimes drop characters when the <code>bufferDelay</code> is low and the user types very quickly. Some developers prefer to skip this prop entirely and instead use <code>setNativeProps</code> to directly manipulate the TextInput value when necessary. For example, the following code demonstrates clearing the input when you tap a button:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.clearText = this.clearText.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  clearText() {\n    this._textInput.setNativeProps({text: ''});\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\n        &lt;TextInput ref={component =&gt; this._textInput = component}\n                   style={styles.textInput} /&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={this.clearText}&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Clear text&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://rnplay.org/plays/pOI9bA\">Run this example</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"avoiding-conflicts-with-the-render-function\">\nAvoiding conflicts with the render function </h2>\n<p>If you update a property that is also managed by the render function, you might end up with some unpredictable and confusing bugs because anytime the component re-renders and that property changes, whatever value was previously set from <code>setNativeProps</code> will be completely ignored and overridden. <a href=\"https://rnplay.org/apps/bp1DvQ\">See this example</a> for a demonstration of what can happen if these two collide - notice the jerky animation each 250ms when <code>setState</code> triggers a re-render.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setnativeprops-shouldcomponentupdate\">\nsetNativeProps &amp; shouldComponentUpdate </h2>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html#avoiding-reconciling-the-dom\">intelligently applying <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code></a> you can avoid the unnecessary overhead involved in reconciling unchanged component subtrees, to the point where it may be performant enough to use <code>setState</code> instead of <code>setNativeProps</code>.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/DirectManipulation.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

Because React Native projects are essentially made up of an Android project, an iOS project and a JavaScript project, all combined under an npm package, upgrading can be rather tricky.

Let's say we would like to be able to create a toast message from JavaScript.</p>\n<p>We start by creating a native module. A native module is a Java class that usually extends the <code>ReactContextBaseJavaModule</code> class and implements the functionality required by the JavaScript. Our goal here is to be able to write <code>ToastAndroid.show('Awesome', ToastAndroid.SHORT);</code> from JavaScript to display a short toast on the screen.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">package com.facebook.react.modules.toast;\n\nimport android.widget.Toast;\n\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.NativeModule;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContext;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;\nimport com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;\n\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic class ToastModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n  private static final String DURATION_SHORT_KEY = \"SHORT\";\n  private static final String DURATION_LONG_KEY = \"LONG\";\n\n  public ToastModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {\n    super(reactContext);\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><code>ReactContextBaseJavaModule</code> requires that a method called <code>getName</code> is implemented. The purpose of this method is to return the string name of the <code>NativeModule</code> which represents this class in JavaScript. So here we will call this <code>ToastAndroid</code> so that we can access it through <code>React.NativeModules.ToastAndroid</code> in JavaScript.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">  @Override\n  public String getName() {\n    return \"ToastAndroid\";\n  }</pre>\n<p>An optional method called <code>getConstants</code> returns the constant values exposed to JavaScript. Its implementation is not required but is very useful to key pre-defined values that need to be communicated from JavaScript to Java in sync.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">  @Override\n  public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getConstants() {\n    final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; constants = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    constants.put(DURATION_SHORT_KEY, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);\n    constants.put(DURATION_LONG_KEY, Toast.LENGTH_LONG);\n    return constants;\n  }</pre>\n<p>To expose a method to JavaScript a Java method must be annotated using <code>@ReactMethod</code>. The return type of bridge methods is always <code>void</code>. React Native bridge is asynchronous, so the only way to pass a result to JavaScript is by using callbacks or emitting events (see below).</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">  @ReactMethod\n  public void show(String message, int duration) {\n    Toast.makeText(getReactApplicationContext(), message, duration).show();\n  }</pre>\n<h3 id=\"argument-types\">\nArgument Types </h3>\n<p>The following argument types are supported for methods annotated with <code>@ReactMethod</code> and they directly map to their JavaScript equivalents</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">Boolean -&gt; Bool\nInteger -&gt; Number\nDouble -&gt; Number\nFloat -&gt; Number\nString -&gt; String\nCallback -&gt; function\nReadableMap -&gt; Object\nReadableArray -&gt; Array</pre>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/bridge/ReadableMap.java\">ReadableMap</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/bridge/ReadableArray.java\">ReadableArray</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"register-the-module\">\nRegister the Module </h3>\n<p>The last step within Java is to register the Module; this happens in the <code>createNativeModules</code> of your apps package.

This file exists under the android folder in your react-native application directory. The path to this file is: <code>android/app/src/main/java/com/your-app-name/MainApplication.java</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">protected List&lt;ReactPackage&gt; getPackages() {\n    return Arrays.&lt;ReactPackage&gt;asList(\n            new MainReactPackage(),\n            new AnExampleReactPackage()); // &lt;-- Add this line with your package name.\n}</pre>\n<p>To make it simpler to access your new functionality from JavaScript, it is common to wrap the native module in a JavaScript module. This is not necessary but saves the consumers of your library the need to pull it off of <code>NativeModules</code> each time. This JavaScript file also becomes a good location for you to add any JavaScript side functionality.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">'use strict';\n/**\n * This exposes the native ToastAndroid module as a JS module.

It can, however, store the callback and invoke it later.</p>\n<p>It is very important to highlight that the callback is not invoked immediately after the native function completes - remember that bridge communication is asynchronous, and this too is tied to the run loop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"promises\">\nPromises </h3>\n<p>Native modules can also fulfill a promise, which can simplify your code, especially when using ES2016's <code>async/await</code> syntax. When the last parameter of a bridged native method is a <code>Promise</code>, its corresponding JS method will return a JS Promise object.</p>\n<p>Refactoring the above code to use a promise instead of callbacks looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">public class UIManagerModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {\n\n...\n\n  @ReactMethod\n  public void measureLayout(\n      int tag,\n      int ancestorTag,\n      Promise promise) {\n    try {\n      measureLayout(tag, ancestorTag, mMeasureBuffer);\n\n      WritableMap map = Arguments.createMap();\n\n      map.putDouble(\"relativeX\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[0]));\n      map.putDouble(\"relativeY\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[1]));\n      map.putDouble(\"width\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[2]));\n      map.putDouble(\"height\", PixelUtil.toDIPFromPixel(mMeasureBuffer[3]));\n\n      promise.resolve(map);\n    } catch (IllegalViewOperationException e) {\n      promise.reject(e);\n    }\n  }\n\n...</pre>\n<p>The JavaScript counterpart of this method returns a Promise. This means you can use the <code>await</code> keyword within an async function to call it and wait for its result:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">async function measureLayout() {\n  try {\n    var {\n      relativeX,\n      relativeY,\n      width,\n      height,\n    } = await UIManager.measureLayout(100, 100);\n\n    console.log(relativeX + ':' + relativeY + ':' + width + ':' + height);\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(e);\n  }\n}\n\nmeasureLayout();</pre>\n<h3 id=\"threading\">\nThreading </h3>\n<p>Native modules should not have any assumptions about what thread they are being called on, as the current assignment is subject to change in the future. If a blocking call is required, the heavy work should be dispatched to an internally managed worker thread, and any callbacks distributed from there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sending-events-to-javascript\">\nSending Events to JavaScript </h3>\n<p>Native modules can signal events to JavaScript without being invoked directly. The easiest way to do this is to use the <code>RCTDeviceEventEmitter</code> which can be obtained from the <code>ReactContext</code> as in the code snippet below.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">...\nprivate void sendEvent(ReactContext reactContext,\n                       String eventName,\n                       @Nullable WritableMap params) {\n  reactContext\n      .getJSModule(DeviceEventManagerModule.RCTDeviceEventEmitter.class)\n      .emit(eventName, params);\n}\n...\nWritableMap params = Arguments.createMap();\n...\nsendEvent(reactContext, \"keyboardWillShow\", params);</pre>\n<p>JavaScript modules can then register to receive events by <code>addListenerOn</code> using the <code>Subscribable</code> mixin</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native';\n...\n\nvar ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\n\n\n  componentWillMount: function() {\n    ...\n    this.addListenerOn(DeviceEventEmitter,\n                       'keyboardWillShow',\n                       this.scrollResponderKeyboardWillShow);\n    ...\n  },\n  scrollResponderKeyboardWillShow:function(e: Event) {\n    this.keyboardWillOpenTo = e;\n    this.props.onKeyboardWillShow &amp;&amp; this.props.onKeyboardWillShow(e);\n  },</pre>\n<p>You can also directly use the <code>DeviceEventEmitter</code> module to listen for events.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">...\ncomponentWillMount: function() {\n  DeviceEventEmitter.addListener('keyboardWillShow', function(e: Event) {\n    // handle event.\n  });\n}\n...</pre>\n<h3 id=\"getting-activity-result-from-startactivityforresult\">\nGetting activity result from <code>startActivityForResult</code> </h3>\n<p>You'll need to listen to <code>onActivityResult</code> if you want to get results from an activity you started with <code>startActivityForResult</code>.

Then, you need to register a listener in the module's constructor,</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">reactContext.addActivityEventListener(this);</pre>\n<p>Now you can listen to <code>onActivityResult</code> by implementing the following method:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">@Override\npublic void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode, final Intent intent) {\n  // Your logic here\n}</pre>\n<p>We will implement a simple image picker to demonstrate this.

That is where <code>subspec</code>s come in. When you create your <code>Podfile</code>, you are going to specify React Native library dependencies that you will want installed so that your application can use those libraries. Each library will become a <code>subspec</code> in the <code>Podfile</code>.</p>\n<p>The list of supported <code>subspec</code>s are in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React.podspec\"><code>node_modules/react-native/React.podspec</code></a>. They are generally named by functionality. For example, you will generally always want the <code>Core</code> <code>subspec</code>. That will get you the <code>AppRegistry</code>, <code>StyleSheet</code>, <code>View</code> and other core React Native libraries. If you want to add the React Native <code>Text</code> library (e.g., for <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> elements), then you will need the <code>RCTText</code> <code>subspec</code>.

Like everything in React Native, Animation APIs for React Native are currently under development, but have started to coalesce around two complementary systems: <code>LayoutAnimation</code> for animated global layout transactions, and <code>Animated</code> for more granular and interactive control of specific values.</p>\n<h3 id=\"animated\">\nAnimated </h3>\n<p>The <code>Animated</code> library is designed to make it very easy to concisely express a wide variety of interesting animation and interaction patterns in a very performant way. <code>Animated</code> focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and simple <code>start</code>/<code>stop</code> methods to control time-based animation execution. For example, a complete component with a simple spring bounce on mount looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class Playground extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      bounceValue: new Animated.Value(0),\n    };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Animated.Image                         // Base: Image, Text, View\n        source={{uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/XMKOH81.jpg'}}\n        style={{\n          flex: 1,\n          transform: [                        // `transform` is an ordered array\n            {scale: this.state.bounceValue},  // Map `bounceValue` to `scale`\n          ]\n        }}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.state.bounceValue.setValue(1.5);     // Start large\n    Animated.spring(                          // Base: spring, decay, timing\n      this.state.bounceValue,                 // Animate `bounceValue`\n      {\n        toValue: 0.8,                         // Animate to smaller size\n        friction: 1,                          // Bouncier spring\n      }\n    ).start();                                // Start the animation\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><code>bounceValue</code> is initialized as part of <code>state</code> in the constructor, and mapped to the scale transform on the image. Behind the scenes, the numeric value is extracted and used to set scale. When the component mounts, the scale is set to 1.5 and then a spring animation is started on <code>bounceValue</code> which will update all of its dependent mappings on each frame as the spring animates (in this case, just the scale). This is done in an optimized way that is faster than calling <code>setState</code> and re-rendering. Because the entire configuration is declarative, we will be able to implement further optimizations that serialize the configuration and runs the animation on a high-priority thread.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-api\">\nCore API </h4>\n<p>Most everything you need hangs directly off the <code>Animated</code> module. This includes two value types, <code>Value</code> for single values and <code>ValueXY</code> for vectors, three animation types, <code>spring</code>, <code>decay</code>, and <code>timing</code>, and three component types, <code>View</code>, <code>Text</code>, and <code>Image</code>. You can make any other component animated with <code>Animated.createAnimatedComponent</code>.</p>\n<p>The three animation types can be used to create almost any animation curve you want because each can be customized:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>spring</code>: Simple single-spring physics model that matches <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/origami/\">Origami</a>.<ul>\n<li>\n<code>friction</code>: Controls \"bounciness\"/overshoot. Default 7.</li>\n<li>\n<code>tension</code>: Controls speed. Default 40.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>decay</code>: Starts with an initial velocity and gradually slows to a stop.<ul>\n<li>\n<code>velocity</code>: Initial velocity. Required.</li>\n<li>\n<code>deceleration</code>: Rate of decay. Default 0.997.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>timing</code>: Maps time range to easing value.<ul>\n<li>\n<code>duration</code>: Length of animation (milliseconds). Default 500.</li>\n<li>\n<code>easing</code>: Easing function to define curve. See <code>Easing</code> module for several predefined functions. iOS default is <code>Easing.inOut(Easing.ease)</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>delay</code>: Start the animation after delay (milliseconds). Default 0.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Animations are started by calling <code>start</code>. <code>start</code> takes a completion callback that will be called when the animation is done. If the animation is done because it finished running normally, the completion callback will be invoked with <code>{finished: true}</code>, but if the animation is done because <code>stop</code> was called on it before it could finish (e.g. because it was interrupted by a gesture or another animation), then it will receive <code>{finished: false}</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"composing-animations\">\nComposing Animations </h4>\n<p>Animations can also be composed with <code>parallel</code>, <code>sequence</code>, <code>stagger</code>, and <code>delay</code>, each of which simply take an array of animations to execute and automatically calls start/stop as appropriate. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">Animated.sequence([            // spring to start and twirl after decay finishes\n  Animated.decay(position, {   // coast to a stop\n    velocity: {x: gestureState.vx, y: gestureState.vy}, // velocity from gesture release\n    deceleration: 0.997,\n  }),\n  Animated.parallel([          // after decay, in parallel:\n    Animated.spring(position, {\n      toValue: {x: 0, y: 0}    // return to start\n    }),\n    Animated.timing(twirl, {   // and twirl\n      toValue: 360,\n    }),\n  ]),\n]).start();                    // start the sequence group</pre>\n<p>By default, if one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other animations in the group are also stopped. Parallel has a <code>stopTogether</code> option that can be set to <code>false</code> to disable this.</p>\n<h4 id=\"interpolation\">\nInterpolation </h4>\n<p>Another powerful part of the <code>Animated</code> API is the <code>interpolate</code> function. It allows input ranges to map to different output ranges. For example, a simple mapping to convert a 0-1 range to a 0-100 range would be</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">value.interpolate({\n  inputRange: [0, 1],\n  outputRange: [0, 100],\n});</pre>\n<p><code>interpolate</code> supports multiple range segments as well, which is handy for defining dead zones and other handy tricks. For example, to get an negation relationship at -300 that goes to 0 at -100, then back up to 1 at 0, and then back down to zero at 100 followed by a dead-zone that remains at 0 for everything beyond that, you could do:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">value.interpolate({\n  inputRange: [-300, -100, 0, 100, 101],\n  outputRange: [300,    0, 1,   0,   0],\n});</pre>\n<p>Which would map like so:</p>\n<table>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td> -400</td>\n<td>450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> -300</td>\n<td>300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> -200</td>\n<td>150</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> -100</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> -50</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 50</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 100</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 101</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 200</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>\n<p><code>interpolation</code> also supports arbitrary easing functions, many of which are already implemented in the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Animation/Animated/Easing.js\"><code>Easing</code></a> class including quadratic, exponential, and bezier curves as well as functions like step and bounce. <code>interpolation</code> also has configurable behavior for extrapolating the <code>outputRange</code>. You can set the extrapolation by setting the <code>extrapolate</code>, <code>extrapolateLeft</code> or <code>extrapolateRight</code> options. The default value is <code>extend</code> but you can use <code>clamp</code> to prevent the output value from exceeding <code>outputRange</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tracking-dynamic-values\">\nTracking Dynamic Values </h4>\n<p>Animated values can also track other values. Just set the <code>toValue</code> of an animation to another animated value instead of a plain number, for example with spring physics for an interaction like \"Chat Heads\", or via <code>timing</code> with <code>duration: 0</code> for rigid/instant tracking. They can also be composed with interpolations:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">Animated.spring(follower, {toValue: leader}).start();\nAnimated.timing(opacity, {\n  toValue: pan.x.interpolate({\n    inputRange: [0, 300],\n    outputRange: [1, 0],\n  }),\n}).start();</pre>\n<p><code>ValueXY</code> is a handy way to deal with 2D interactions, such as panning/dragging. It is a simple wrapper that basically just contains two <code>Animated.Value</code> instances and some helper functions that call through to them, making <code>ValueXY</code> a drop-in replacement for <code>Value</code> in many cases. For example, in the code snippet above, <code>leader</code> and <code>follower</code> could both be of type <code>ValueXY</code> and the x and y values will both track as you would expect.</p>\n<h4 id=\"input-events\">\nInput Events </h4>\n<p><code>Animated.event</code> is the input side of the Animated API, allowing gestures and other events to map directly to animated values. This is done with a structured map syntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects. The first level is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array contains nested objects. In the example, you can see that <code>scrollX</code> maps to <code>event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x</code> (<code>event</code> is normally the first arg to the handler), and <code>pan.x</code> and <code>pan.y</code> map to <code>gestureState.dx</code> and <code>gestureState.dy</code>, respectively (<code>gestureState</code> is the second arg passed to the <code>PanResponder</code> handler).</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">onScroll={Animated.event(\n  // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x\n  [{nativeEvent: {contentOffset: {x: scrollX}}}]\n)}\nonPanResponderMove={Animated.event([\n  null,                                          // ignore the native event\n  // extract dx and dy from gestureState\n  // like 'pan.x = gestureState.dx, pan.y = gestureState.dy'\n  {dx: pan.x, dy: pan.y}\n]);</pre>\n<h4 id=\"responding-to-the-current-animation-value\">\nResponding to the Current Animation Value </h4>\n<p>You may notice that there is no obvious way to read the current value while animating - this is because the value may only be known in the native runtime due to optimizations. If you need to run JavaScript in response to the current value, there are two approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>spring.stopAnimation(callback)</code> will stop the animation and invoke <code>callback</code> with the final value - this is useful when making gesture transitions.</li>\n<li>\n<code>spring.addListener(callback)</code> will invoke <code>callback</code> asynchronously while the animation is running, providing a recent value. This is useful for triggering state changes, for example snapping a bobble to a new option as the user drags it closer, because these larger state changes are less sensitive to a few frames of lag compared to continuous gestures like panning which need to run at 60fps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"future-work\">\nFuture Work </h4>\n<p>As previously mentioned, we're planning on optimizing Animated under the hood to make it even more performant. We would also like to experiment with more declarative and higher level gestures and triggers, such as horizontal vs. vertical panning.</p>\n<p>The above API gives a powerful tool for expressing all sorts of animations in a concise, robust, and performant way. Check out more example code in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Examples/UIExplorer/AnimatedGratuitousApp\">UIExplorer/AnimationExample</a>. Of course there may still be times where <code>Animated</code> doesn't support what you need, and the following sections cover other animation systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"layoutanimation\">\nLayoutAnimation </h3>\n<p><code>LayoutAnimation</code> allows you to globally configure <code>create</code> and <code>update</code> animations that will be used for all views in the next render/layout cycle. This is useful for doing flexbox layout updates without bothering to measure or calculate specific properties in order to animate them directly, and is especially useful when layout changes may affect ancestors, for example a \"see more\" expansion that also increases the size of the parent and pushes down the row below which would otherwise require explicit coordination between the components in order to animate them all in sync.</p>\n<p>Note that although <code>LayoutAnimation</code> is very powerful and can be quite useful, it provides much less control than <code>Animated</code> and other animation libraries, so you may need to use another approach if you can't get <code>LayoutAnimation</code> to do what you want.</p>\n<p>Note that in order to get this to work on <strong>Android</strong> you need to set the following flags via <code>UIManager</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental &amp;&amp; UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);</pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/img/LayoutAnimationExample.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { w: 100, h: 100 };\n    this._onPress = this._onPress.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // Animate creation\n    LayoutAnimation.spring();\n  }\n\n  _onPress() {\n    // Animate the update\n    LayoutAnimation.spring();\n    this.setState({w: this.state.w + 15, h: this.state.h + 15})\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\n        &lt;View style={[styles.box, {width: this.state.w, height: this.state.h}]} /&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPress}&gt;\n          &lt;View style={styles.button}&gt;\n            &lt;Text style={styles.buttonText}&gt;Press me!&lt;/Text&gt;\n          &lt;/View&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://rnplay.org/apps/uaQrGQ\">Run this example</a></p>\n<p>This example uses a preset value, you can customize the animations as you need, see <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/LayoutAnimation/LayoutAnimation.js\">LayoutAnimation.js</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"requestanimationframe\">\nrequestAnimationFrame </h3>\n<p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is a polyfill from the browser that you might be familiar with. It accepts a function as its only argument and calls that function before the next repaint. It is an essential building block for animations that underlies all of the JavaScript-based animation APIs. In general, you shouldn't need to call this yourself - the animation APIs will manage frame updates for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"react-tween-state-not-recommended-use-animated-docs-animations-html-animated-instead\">\nreact-tween-state (Not recommended - use <a href=\"animations#animated\">Animated</a> instead) </h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/chenglou/react-tween-state\">react-tween-state</a> is a minimal library that does exactly what its name suggests: it <em>tweens</em> a value in a component's state, starting at a <strong>from</strong> value and ending at a <strong>to</strong> value. This means that it generates the values in between those two values, and it sets the state on every <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> with the intermediary value.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tweening definition from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n<p>\"... tweening is the process of generating intermediate frames between two images to give the appearance that the first image evolves smoothly into the second image. [Tweens] are the drawings between the key frames which help to create the illusion of motion.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most obvious way to animate from one value to another is linearly: you subtract the end value from the start value and divide the result by the number of frames over which the animation occurs, and then add that value to the current value on each frame until the end value is reached. Linear easing often looks awkward and unnatural, so react-tween-state provides a selection of popular <a href=\"http://easings.net/\">easing functions</a> that can be applied to make your animations more pleasing.</p>\n<p>This library does not ship with React Native - in order to use it on your project, you will need to install it with <code>npm i react-tween-state\n--save</code> from your project directory.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import tweenState from 'react-tween-state';\nimport reactMixin from 'react-mixin'; // https://github.com/brigand/react-mixin\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { opacity: 1 };\n    this._animateOpacity = this._animateOpacity.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  _animateOpacity() {\n    this.tweenState('opacity', {\n      easing: tweenState.easingTypes.easeOutQuint,\n      duration: 1000,\n      endValue: this.state.opacity === 0.2 ? 1 : 0.2,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={{flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={this._animateOpacity}&gt;\n          &lt;View ref={component =&gt; this._box = component}\n                style={{width: 200, height: 200, backgroundColor: 'red',\n                        opacity: this.getTweeningValue('opacity')}} /&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableWithoutFeedback&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nreactMixin.onClass(App, tweenState.Mixin);</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://rnplay.org/apps/4FUQ-A\">Run this example</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/img/TweenState.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here we animated the opacity, but as you might guess, we can animate any numeric value.

It is similar in concept to react-tween-state: you have an initial value and set an end value, then Rebound generates intermediate values that you can use for your animation. Rebound is modeled after spring physics; we don't provide a duration when animating with springs, it is calculated for us depending on the spring tension, friction, current value and end value. Rebound <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=rebound\">is used internally</a> by React Native on <code>Navigator</code> and <code>WarningBox</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/img/ReboundImage.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Notice that Rebound animations can be interrupted - if you release in the middle of a press, it will animate back from the current state to the original value.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import rebound from 'rebound';\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this._onPressIn = this._onPressIn.bind(this);\n    this._onPressOut = this._onPressOut.bind(this);\n  }\n  // First we initialize the spring and add a listener, which calls\n  // setState whenever it updates\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // Initialize the spring that will drive animations\n    this.springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n    this._scrollSpring = this.springSystem.createSpring();\n    var springConfig = this._scrollSpring.getSpringConfig();\n    springConfig.tension = 230;\n    springConfig.friction = 10;\n\n    this._scrollSpring.addListener({\n      onSpringUpdate: () =&gt; {\n        this.setState({scale: this._scrollSpring.getCurrentValue()});\n      },\n    });\n\n    // Initialize the spring value at 1\n    this._scrollSpring.setCurrentValue(1);\n  }\n\n  _onPressIn() {\n    this._scrollSpring.setEndValue(0.5);\n  }\n\n  _onPressOut() {\n    this._scrollSpring.setEndValue(1);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    var imageStyle = {\n      width: 250,\n      height: 200,\n      transform: [{scaleX: this.state.scale}, {scaleY: this.state.scale}],\n    };\n\n    var imageUri = \"img/ReboundExample.png\";\n\n    return (\n      &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableWithoutFeedback onPressIn={this._onPressIn}\n                                  onPressOut={this._onPressOut}&gt;\n          &lt;Image source={{uri: imageUri}} style={imageStyle} /&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableWithoutFeedback&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://rnplay.org/apps/NNI5eA\">Run this example</a></p>\n<p>You can also clamp the spring values so that they don't overshoot and oscillate around the end value. In the above example, we would add <code>this._scrollSpring.setOvershootClampingEnabled(true)</code> to change this. See the below gif for an example of where in your interface you might use this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/img/Rebound.gif\" alt=\"\"> Screenshot from <a href=\"https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-scrollable-tab-view\">react-native-scrollable-tab-view</a>.

You may also want to defer any computationally intensive work until after animations are complete, using the <a href=\"interactionmanager\">InteractionManager</a>.

When we mix native and React Native components, we'll eventually find a need to communicate between these two worlds. Some ways to achieve that have been already mentioned in other guides. This article summarizes available techniques.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">\nIntroduction </h2>\n<p>React Native is inspired by React, so the basic idea of the information flow is similar. The flow in React is one-directional. We maintain a hierarchy of components, in which each component depends only on its parent and own internal state. We do this with properties: data is passed from a parent to its children in a top-down manner. If we have an ancestor component that rely on the state of its descendant, the recommended solution would be to pass down a callback that would be used by the descendant to update the ancestor.</p>\n<p>The same concept applies to React Native. As long as we are building our application purely within the framework, we can drive our app with properties and callbacks. But, when we mix React Native and native components, we need some special, cross-language mechanisms that would allow us to pass information between them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"properties\">\nProperties </h2>\n<p>Properties are the simplest way of cross-component communication. So we need a way to pass properties both from native to React Native, and from React Native to native.</p>\n<h3 id=\"passing-properties-from-native-to-react-native\">\nPassing properties from native to React Native </h3>\n<p>In order to embed a React Native view in a native component, we use <code>RCTRootView</code>. <code>RCTRootView</code> is a <code>UIView</code> that holds a React Native app. It also provides an interface between native side and the hosted app.</p>\n<p><code>RCTRootView</code> has an initializer that allows you to pass arbitrary properties down to the React Native app. The <code>initialProperties</code> parameter has to be an instance of <code>NSDictionary</code>. The dictionary is internally converted into a JSON object that the top-level JS component can reference.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">NSArray *imageList = @[@\"http://foo.com/bar1.png\",\n                       @\"http://foo.com/bar2.png\"];\n\nNSDictionary *props = @{@\"images\" : imageList};\n\nRCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge\n                                                 moduleName:@\"ImageBrowserApp\"\n                                          initialProperties:props];</pre>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">'use strict';\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {\n  AppRegistry,\n  View,\n  Image\n} from 'react-native';\n\nclass ImageBrowserApp extends React.Component {\n  renderImage(imgURI) {\n    return (\n      &lt;Image source={{uri: imgURI}} /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        {this.props.images.map(this.renderImage)}\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('ImageBrowserApp', () =&gt; ImageBrowserApp);</pre>\n<p><code>RCTRootView</code> also provides a read-write property <code>appProperties</code>. After <code>appProperties</code> is set, the React Native app is re-rendered with new properties. The update is only performed when the new updated properties differ from the previous ones.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">NSArray *imageList = @[@\"http://foo.com/bar3.png\",\n                       @\"http://foo.com/bar4.png\"];\n\nrootView.appProperties = @{@\"images\" : imageList};</pre>\n<p>It is fine to update properties anytime. However, updates have to be performed on the main thread. You use the getter on any thread.</p>\n<p>There is no way to update only a few properties at a time. We suggest that you build it into your own wrapper instead.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Currently, JS functions <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> and <code>componentWillUpdateProps</code> of the top level RN component will not be called after a prop update. However, you can access the new props in <code>componentWillMount</code> function.</p></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"passing-properties-from-react-native-to-native\">\nPassing properties from React Native to native </h3>\n<p>The problem exposing properties of native components is covered in detail in <a href=\"native-components-ios#properties\">this article</a>. In short, export properties with <code>RCT_CUSTOM_VIEW_PROPERTY</code> macro in your custom native component, then just use them in React Native as if the component was an ordinary React Native component.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limits-of-properties\">\nLimits of properties </h3>\n<p>The main drawback of cross-language properties is that they do not support callbacks, which would allow us to handle bottom-up data bindings. Imagine you have a small RN view that you want to be removed from the native parent view as a result of a JS action. There is no way to do that with props, as the information would need to go bottom-up.</p>\n<p>Although we have a flavor of cross-language callbacks (<a href=\"native-modules-ios#callbacks\">described here</a>), these callbacks are not always the thing we need. The main problem is that they are not intended to be passed as properties. Rather, this mechanism allows us to trigger a native action from JS, and handle the result of that action in JS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-ways-of-cross-language-interaction-events-and-native-modules\">\nOther ways of cross-language interaction (events and native modules) </h2>\n<p>As stated in the previous chapter, using properties comes with some limitations. Sometimes properties are not enough to drive the logic of our app and we need a solution that gives more flexibility. This chapter covers other communication techniques available in React Native. They can be used for internal communication (between JS and native layers in RN) as well as for external communication (between RN and the 'pure native' part of your app).</p>\n<p>React Native enables you to perform cross-language function calls. You can execute custom native code from JS and vice versa. Unfortunately, depending on the side we are working on, we achieve the same goal in different ways. For native - we use events mechanism to schedule an execution of a handler function in JS, while for React Native we directly call methods exported by native modules.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calling-react-native-functions-from-native-events\">\nCalling React Native functions from native (events) </h3>\n<p>Events are described in detail in <a href=\"native-components-ios#events\">this article</a>. Note that using events gives us no guarantees about execution time, as the event is handled on a separate thread.</p>\n<p>Events are powerful, because they allow us to change React Native components without needing a reference to them. However, there are some pitfalls that you can fall into while using them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As events can be sent from anywhere, they can introduce spaghetti-style dependencies into your project.</li>\n<li>Events share namespace, which means that you may encounter some name collisions. Collisions will not be detected statically, what makes them hard to debug.</li>\n<li>If you use several instances of the same React Native component and you want to distinguish them from the perspective of your event, you'll likely need to introduce some kind of identifiers and pass them along with events (you can use the native view's <code>reactTag</code> as an identifier).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The common pattern we use when embedding native in React Native is to make the native component's RCTViewManager a delegate for the views, sending events back to JavaScript via the bridge. This keeps related event calls in one place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calling-native-functions-from-react-native-native-modules\">\nCalling native functions from React Native (native modules) </h3>\n<p>Native modules are Objective-C classes that are available in JS. Typically one instance of each module is created per JS bridge. They can export arbitrary functions and constants to React Native. They have been covered in detail in <a href=\"native-modules-ios#content\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>The fact that native modules are singletons limits the mechanism in context of embedding. Let's say we have a React Native component embedded in a native view and we want to update the native, parent view. Using the native module mechanism, we would export a function that not only takes expected arguments, but also an identifier of the parent native view. The identifier would be used to retrieve a reference to the parent view to update. That said, we would need to keep a mapping from identifiers to native views in the module.</p>\n<p>Although this solution is complex, it is used in <code>RCTUIManager</code>, which is an internal React Native class that manages all React Native views.</p>\n<p>Native modules can also be used to expose existing native libraries to JS. <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Libraries/Geolocation\">Geolocation library</a> is a living example of the idea.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Warning</em></strong>: All native modules share the same namespace. Watch out for name collisions when creating new ones.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"layout-computation-flow\">\nLayout computation flow </h2>\n<p>When integrating native and React Native, we also need a way to consolidate two different layout systems. This section covers common layouting problems and provides a brief description of mechanisms that are intended to address them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"layout-of-a-native-component-embedded-in-react-native\">\nLayout of a native component embedded in React Native </h3>\n<p>This case is covered in <a href=\"native-components-ios#styles\">this article</a>. Basically, as all our native react views are subclasses of <code>UIView</code>, most style and size attributes will work like you would expect out of the box.</p>\n<h3 id=\"layout-of-a-react-native-component-embedded-in-native\">\nLayout of a React Native component embedded in native </h3>\n<h4 id=\"react-native-content-with-fixed-size\">\nReact Native content with fixed size </h4>\n<p>The simplest scenario is when we have a React Native app with a fixed size, which is known to the native side. In particular, a full-screen React Native view falls into this case. If we want a smaller root view, we can explicitly set RCTRootView's frame.</p>\n<p>For instance, to make an RN app 200 (logical) pixels high, and the hosting view's width wide, we could do:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// SomeViewController.m\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n  [...]\n  RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge\n                                                   moduleName:appName\n                                            initialProperties:props];\n  rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.width, 200);\n  [self.view addSubview:rootView];\n}</pre>\n<p>When we have a fixed size root view, we need to respect its bounds on the JS side. In other words, we need to ensure that the React Native content can be contained within the fixed-size root view. The easiest way to ensure this is to use flexbox layout. If you use absolute positioning, and React components are visible outside the root view's bounds, you'll get overlap with native views, causing some features to behave unexpectedly. For instance, 'TouchableHighlight' will not highlight your touches outside the root view's bounds.</p>\n<p>It's totally fine to update root view's size dynamically by re-setting its frame property. React Native will take care of the content's layout.</p>\n<h4 id=\"react-native-content-with-flexible-size\">\nReact Native content with flexible size </h4>\n<p>In some cases we'd like to render content of initially unknown size. Let's say the size will be defined dynamically in JS. We have two solutions to this problem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can wrap your React Native view in <code>ScrollView</code> component. This guarantees that your content will always be available and it won't overlap with native views.</li>\n<li>React Native allows you to determine, in JS, the size of the RN app and provide it to the owner of the hosting <code>RCTRootView</code>. The owner is then responsible for re-laying out the subviews and keeping the UI consistent. We achieve this with <code>RCTRootView</code>'s flexibility modes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>RCTRootView</code> supports 4 different size flexibility modes:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// RCTRootView.h\n\ntypedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, RCTRootViewSizeFlexibility) {\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityNone = 0,\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidth,\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight,\n  RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidthAndHeight,\n};</pre>\n<p><code>RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityNone</code> is the default value, which makes a root view's size fixed (but it still can be updated with <code>setFrame:</code>). The other three modes allow us to track React Native content's size updates. For instance, setting mode to <code>RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight</code> will cause React Native to measure the content's height and pass that information back to <code>RCTRootView</code>'s delegate. An arbitrary action can be performed within the delegate, including setting the root view's frame, so the content fits. The delegate is called only when the size of the content has changed.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Warning:</em></strong> Making a dimension flexible in both JS and native leads to undefined behavior. For example - don't make a top-level React component's width flexible (with <code>flexbox</code>) while you're using <code>RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityWidth</code> on the hosting <code>RCTRootView</code>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let's look at an example.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// FlexibleSizeExampleView.m\n\n- (instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame\n{\n  [...]\n\n  _rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge\n  moduleName:@\"FlexibilityExampleApp\"\n  initialProperties:@{}];\n\n  _rootView.delegate = self;\n  _rootView.sizeFlexibility = RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight;\n  _rootView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, 0);\n}\n\n#pragma mark - RCTRootViewDelegate\n- (void)rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:(RCTRootView *)rootView\n{\n  CGRect newFrame = rootView.frame;\n  newFrame.size = rootView.intrinsicSize;\n\n  rootView.frame = newFrame;\n}</pre>\n<p>In the example we have a <code>FlexibleSizeExampleView</code> view that holds a root view. We create the root view, initialize it and set the delegate. The delegate will handle size updates. Then, we set the root view's size flexibility to <code>RCTRootViewSizeFlexibilityHeight</code>, which means that <code>rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:</code> method will be called every time the React Native content changes its height. Finally, we set the root view's width and position. Note that we set there height as well, but it has no effect as we made the height RN-dependent.</p>\n<p>You can checkout full source code of the example <a href=\"https://phabricator.fb.com/diffusion/FBOBJC/browse/master/Libraries/FBReactKit/js/react-native-github/Examples/UIExplorer/UIExplorer/NativeExampleViews/FlexibleSizeExampleView.m\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It's fine to change root view's size flexibility mode dynamically. Changing flexibility mode of a root view will schedule a layout recalculation and the delegate <code>rootViewDidChangeIntrinsicSize:</code> method will be called once the content size is known.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> React Native layout calculation is performed on a special thread, while native UI view updates are done on the main thread. This may cause temporary UI inconsistencies between native and React Native. This is a known problem and our team is working on synchronizing UI updates coming from different sources.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> React Native does not perform any layout calculations until the root view becomes a subview of some other views. If you want to hide React Native view until its dimensions are known, add the root view as a subview and make it initially hidden (use <code>UIView</code>'s <code>hidden</code> property). Then change its visibility in the delegate method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/CommunicationIOS.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<p>Recently, we have been working hard to make the documentation better based on your feedback.

Remember, Android supports 10k+ different phones and is generalized to support software rendering: the framework architecture and need to generalize across many hardware targets unfortunately means you get less for free relative to iOS. But sometimes, there are things you can improve (and many times it's not native code's fault at all!).</p>\n<p>The first step for debugging this jank is to answer the fundamental question of where your time is being spent during each 16ms frame. For that, we'll be using a standard Android profiling tool called systrace. But first...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make sure that JS dev mode is OFF!</p>\n<p>You should see <code>__DEV__ === false, development-level warning are OFF, performance optimizations are ON</code> in your application logs (which you can view using <code>adb logcat</code>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"profiling-with-systrace\">\nProfiling with Systrace </h2>\n<p>Systrace is a standard Android marker-based profiling tool (and is installed when you install the Android platform-tools package).

Run systrace as follows</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">$ &lt;path_to_android_sdk&gt;/platform-tools/systrace/systrace.py --time=10 -o trace.html sched gfx view -a &lt;your_package_name&gt;</pre>\n<p>A quick breakdown of this command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>time</code> is the length of time the trace will be collected in seconds</li>\n<li>\n<code>sched</code>, <code>gfx</code>, and <code>view</code> are the android SDK tags (collections of markers) we care about: <code>sched</code> gives you information about what's running on each core of your phone, <code>gfx</code> gives you graphics info such as frame boundaries, and <code>view</code> gives you information about measure, layout, and draw passes</li>\n<li>\n<code>-a &lt;your_package_name&gt;</code> enables app-specific markers, specifically the ones built into the React Native framework. <code>your_package_name</code> can be found in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> of your app and looks like <code>com.example.app</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the trace starts collecting, perform the animation or interaction you care about.

The minimal API is to create a <a href=\"listviewdatasource\"><code>ListView.DataSource</code></a>, populate it with a simple array of data blobs, and instantiate a <code>ListView</code> component with that data source and a <code>renderRow</code> callback which takes a blob from the data array and returns a renderable component.</p>\n<p>Minimal example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">getInitialState: function() {\n  var ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) =&gt; r1 !== r2});\n  return {\n    dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows(['row 1', 'row 2']),\n  };\n},\n\nrender: function() {\n  return (\n    &lt;ListView\n      dataSource={this.state.dataSource}\n      renderRow={(rowData) =&gt; &lt;Text&gt;{rowData}&lt;/Text&gt;}\n    /&gt;\n  );\n},</pre>\n<p>ListView also supports more advanced features, including sections with sticky section headers, header and footer support, callbacks on reaching the end of the available data (<code>onEndReached</code>) and on the set of rows that are visible in the device viewport change (<code>onChangeVisibleRows</code>), and several performance optimizations.</p>\n<p>There are a few performance operations designed to make ListView scroll smoothly while dynamically loading potentially very large (or conceptually infinite) data sets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Only re-render changed rows - the rowHasChanged function provided to the data source tells the ListView if it needs to re-render a row because the source data has changed - see ListViewDataSource for more details.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rate-limited row rendering - By default, only one row is rendered per event-loop (customizable with the <code>pageSize</code> prop). This breaks up the work into smaller chunks to reduce the chance of dropping frames while rendering rows.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"props\">\nProps </h2>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"scrollview\">\n<a href=\"scrollview#props\">ScrollView props...</a> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"datasource\">\ndataSource <span class=\"propType\">ListViewDataSource</span> </h3>\n<div><p>An instance of <a href=\"listviewdatasource\">ListView.DataSource</a> to use</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"enableemptysections\">\nenableEmptySections <span class=\"propType\">bool</span> </h3>\n<div><p>Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.

By default the data is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to provide custom extractors. ListView can be notified when a row is being highlighted by calling <code>highlightRow(sectionID, rowID)</code>. This sets a boolean value of adjacentRowHighlighted in renderSeparator, allowing you to control the separators above and below the highlighted row. The highlighted state of a row can be reset by calling highlightRow(null).</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"renderscrollcomponent\">\nrenderScrollComponent <span class=\"propType\">function</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>(props) =&gt; renderable</p>\n<p>A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.

If you are targeting iOS only, you may also want to consider using <a href=\"navigatorios\"><code>NavigatorIOS</code></a> as it leverages native UIKit navigation.</p>\n<p>To set up the <code>Navigator</code> you provide one or more objects called routes, to identify each scene. You also provide a <code>renderScene</code> function that renders the scene for each route object.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { Text, Navigator } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class NavAllDay extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Navigator\n        initialRoute={{ title: 'Awesome Scene', index: 0 }}\n        renderScene={(route, navigator) =&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Hello {route.title}!&lt;/Text&gt;\n        }\n        style={{padding: 100}}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>In the above example, <code>initialRoute</code> is used to specify the first route. It contains a <code>title</code> property that identifies the route. The <code>renderScene</code> prop returns a function that displays text based on the route's title.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-scenes\">\nAdditional Scenes </h3>\n<p>The first example demonstrated one scene. To set up multiple scenes, you pass the <code>initialRouteStack</code> prop to <code>Navigator</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">render() {\n  const routes = [\n    {title: 'First Scene', index: 0},\n    {title: 'Second Scene', index: 1},\n  ];\n  return (\n    &lt;Navigator\n      initialRoute={routes[0]}\n      initialRouteStack={routes}\n      renderScene={(route, navigator) =&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={() =&gt; {\n          if (route.index === 0) {\n            navigator.push(routes[1]);\n          } else {\n            navigator.pop();\n          }\n        }}&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Hello {route.title}!&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n      }\n      style={{padding: 100}}\n    /&gt;\n  );\n}</pre>\n<p>In the above example, a <code>routes</code> variable is defined with two route objects representing two scenes. Each route has an <code>index</code> property that is used to manage the scene being rendered. The <code>renderScene</code> method is changed to either push or pop the navigator depending on the current route's index. Finally, the <code>Text</code> component in the scene is now wrapped in a <code>TouchableHighlight</code> component to help trigger the navigator transitions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"navigation-bar\">\nNavigation Bar </h3>\n<p>You can optionally pass in your own navigation bar by returning a <code>Navigator.NavigationBar</code> component to the <code>navigationBar</code> prop in <code>Navigator</code>. You can configure the navigation bar properties, through the <code>routeMapper</code> prop. There you set up the left, right, and title properties of the navigation bar:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Navigator\n  renderScene={(route, navigator) =&gt;\n    // ...\n  }\n  navigationBar={\n     &lt;Navigator.NavigationBar\n       routeMapper={{\n         LeftButton: (route, navigator, index, navState) =&gt;\n          { return (&lt;Text&gt;Cancel&lt;/Text&gt;); },\n         RightButton: (route, navigator, index, navState) =&gt;\n           { return (&lt;Text&gt;Done&lt;/Text&gt;); },\n         Title: (route, navigator, index, navState) =&gt;\n           { return (&lt;Text&gt;Awesome Nav Bar&lt;/Text&gt;); },\n       }}\n       style={{backgroundColor: 'gray'}}\n     /&gt;\n  }\n/&gt;</pre>\n<p>When configuring the left, right, and title items for the navigation bar, you have access to info such as the current route object and navigation state. This allows you to customize the title for each scene as well as the buttons. For example, you can choose to hide the left button for one of the scenes.</p>\n<p>Typically you want buttons to represent the left and right buttons. Building on the previous example, you can set this up as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">LeftButton: (route, navigator, index, navState) =&gt;\n  {\n    if (route.index === 0) {\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return (\n        &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={() =&gt; navigator.pop()}&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Back&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n      );\n    }\n  },</pre>\n<p>This sets up a left navigator bar button that's visible on scenes after the the first one. When the button is tapped the navigator is popped.</p>\n<p>Another type of navigation bar, with breadcrumbs, is provided by <code>Navigator.BreadcrumbNavigationBar</code>. You can also provide your own navigation bar by passing it through the <code>navigationBar</code> prop. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Examples/UIExplorer\">UIExplorer</a> demo to try out both built-in navigation bars out and see how to use them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scene-transitions\">\nScene Transitions </h3>\n<p>To change the animation or gesture properties of the scene, provide a <code>configureScene</code> prop to get the config object for a given route:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Navigator\n  renderScene={(route, navigator) =&gt;\n    // ...\n  }\n  configureScene={(route, routeStack) =&gt;\n    Navigator.SceneConfigs.FloatFromBottom}\n/&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example, the newly pushed scene will float up from the bottom. See <code>Navigator.SceneConfigs</code> for default animations and more info on available <a href=\"navigator#configurescene\">scene config options</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"props\">\nProps </h2>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"configurescene\">\nconfigureScene <span class=\"propType\">function</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>Optional function where you can configure scene animations and gestures.

A Toolbar can display a logo, navigation icon (e.g. hamburger menu), a title &amp; subtitle and a list of actions. The title and subtitle are expanded so the logo and navigation icons are displayed on the left, title and subtitle in the middle and the actions on the right.</p>\n<p>If the toolbar has an only child, it will be displayed between the title and actions.</p>\n<p>Although the Toolbar supports remote images for the logo, navigation and action icons, this should only be used in DEV mode where <code>require('./some_icon.png')</code> translates into a packager URL. In release mode you should always use a drawable resource for these icons. Using <code>require('./some_icon.png')</code> will do this automatically for you, so as long as you don't explicitly use e.g. <code>{uri: 'http://...'}</code>, you will be good.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">render: function() {\n  return (\n    &lt;ToolbarAndroid\n      logo={require('./app_logo.png')}\n      title=\"AwesomeApp\"\n      actions={[{title: 'Settings', icon: require('./icon_settings.png'), show: 'always'}]}\n      onActionSelected={this.onActionSelected} /&gt;\n  )\n},\nonActionSelected: function(position) {\n  if (position === 0) { // index of 'Settings'\n    showSettings();\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"props\">\nProps </h2>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"view\">\n<a href=\"view#props\">View props...</a> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"actions\">\nactions <span class=\"propType\">ReactPropTypes.arrayOf(ReactPropTypes.shape({ title: ReactPropTypes.string.isRequired, icon: optionalImageSource, show: ReactPropTypes.oneOf(['always', 'ifRoom', 'never']), showWithText: ReactPropTypes.bool }))</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>Sets possible actions on the toolbar as part of the action menu.

It works exactly the same as it would on a native app using <code>UINavigationController</code>, providing the same animations and behavior from UIKIt.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, it is only available on iOS. Take a look at <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/docs/navigator.html\"><code>Navigator</code></a> for a similar solution for your cross-platform needs, or check out <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation\">react-native-navigation</a>, a component that aims to provide native navigation on both iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>To set up the navigator, provide the <code>initialRoute</code> prop with a route object. A route object is used to describe each scene that your app navigates to. <code>initialRoute</code> represents the first route in your navigator.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { NavigatorIOS, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nexport default class NavigatorIOSApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;NavigatorIOS\n        initialRoute={{\n          component: MyScene,\n          title: 'My Initial Scene',\n        }}\n        style={{flex: 1}}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyScene extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    navigator: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n  }\n\n  constructor(props, context) {\n    super(props, context);\n    this._onForward = this._onForward.bind(this);\n    this._onBack = this._onBack.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  _onForward() {\n    this.props.navigator.push({\n      title: 'Scene ' + nextIndex,\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;View&gt;\n        &lt;Text&gt;Current Scene: { this.props.title }&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={this._onForward}&gt;\n          &lt;Text&gt;Tap me to load the next scene&lt;/Text&gt;\n        &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n      &lt;/View&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>In this code, the navigator renders the component specified in initialRoute, which in this case is <code>MyScene</code>. This component will receive a <code>route</code> prop and a <code>navigator</code> prop representing the navigator. The navigator's navigation bar will render the title for the current scene, \"My Initial Scene\".</p>\n<p>You can optionally pass in a <code>passProps</code> property to your <code>initialRoute</code>. <code>NavigatorIOS</code> passes this in as props to the rendered component:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">initialRoute={{\n  component: MyScene,\n  title: 'My Initial Scene',\n  passProps: { myProp: 'foo' }\n}}</pre>\n<p>You can then access the props passed in via <code>{this.props.myProp}</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"handling-navigation\">\nHandling Navigation </h4>\n<p>To trigger navigation functionality such as pushing or popping a view, you have access to a <code>navigator</code> object. The object is passed in as a prop to any component that is rendered by <code>NavigatorIOS</code>. You can then call the relevant methods to perform the navigation action you need:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class MyView extends Component {\n  _handleBackPress() {\n    this.props.navigator.pop();\n  }\n\n  _handleNextPress(nextRoute) {\n    this.props.navigator.push(nextRoute);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const nextRoute = {\n      component: MyView,\n      title: 'Bar That',\n      passProps: { myProp: 'bar' }\n    };\n    return(\n      &lt;TouchableHighlight onPress={() =&gt; this._handleNextPress(nextRoute)}&gt;\n        &lt;Text style={{marginTop: 200, alignSelf: 'center'}}&gt;\n          See you on the other nav {this.props.myProp}!\n        &lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/TouchableHighlight&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>You can also trigger navigator functionality from the <code>NavigatorIOS</code> component:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">class NavvyIOS extends Component {\n  _handleNavigationRequest() {\n    this.refs.nav.push({\n      component: MyView,\n      title: 'Genius',\n      passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;NavigatorIOS\n        ref='nav'\n        initialRoute={{\n          component: MyView,\n          title: 'Foo This',\n          passProps: { myProp: 'foo' },\n          rightButtonTitle: 'Add',\n          onRightButtonPress: () =&gt; this._handleNavigationRequest(),\n        }}\n        style={{flex: 1}}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The code above adds a <code>_handleNavigationRequest</code> private method that is invoked from the <code>NavigatorIOS</code> component when the right navigation bar item is pressed. To get access to the navigator functionality, a reference to it is saved in the <code>ref</code> prop and later referenced to push a new scene into the navigation stack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"navigation-bar-configuration\">\nNavigation Bar Configuration </h4>\n<p>Props passed to <code>NavigatorIOS</code> will set the default configuration for the navigation bar. Props passed as properties to a route object will set the configuration for that route's navigation bar, overriding any props passed to the <code>NavigatorIOS</code> component.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">_handleNavigationRequest() {\n  this.refs.nav.push({\n    //...\n    passProps: { myProp: 'genius' },\n    barTintColor: '#996699',\n  });\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    &lt;NavigatorIOS\n      //...\n      style={{flex: 1}}\n      barTintColor='#ffffcc'\n    /&gt;\n  );\n}</pre>\n<p>In the example above the navigation bar color is changed when the new route is pushed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"props\">\nProps </h2>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"bartintcolor\">\nbarTintColor <span class=\"propType\">string</span> </h3>\n<div><p>The default background color of the navigation bar.</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"initialroute\">\ninitialRoute <span class=\"propType\">{component: function, title: string, titleImage: Image.propTypes.source, passProps: object, backButtonIcon: Image.propTypes.source, backButtonTitle: string, leftButtonIcon: Image.propTypes.source, leftButtonTitle: string, onLeftButtonPress: function, rightButtonIcon: Image.propTypes.source, rightButtonTitle: string, onRightButtonPress: function, wrapperStyle: [object Object], navigationBarHidden: bool, shadowHidden: bool, tintColor: string, barTintColor: string, titleTextColor: string, translucent: bool}</span> </h3>\n<div><p>NavigatorIOS uses <code>route</code> objects to identify child views, their props, and navigation bar configuration.

In practice, this is very tedious. For React Native, we decided to use web paradigm for this where you can nest text to achieve the same effect.</p>\n<div class=\"web-player\"><pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';\n\nclass BoldAndBeautiful extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}&gt;\n        I am bold\n        &lt;Text style={{color: 'red'}}&gt;\n          and red\n        &lt;/Text&gt;\n      &lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BoldAndBeautiful', () =&gt; BoldAndBeautiful);</pre></div>\n<p>Behind the scenes, React Native converts this to a flat <code>NSAttributedString</code> or <code>SpannableString</code> that contains the following information:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">\"I am bold and red\"\n0-9: bold\n9-17: bold, red</pre>\n<h2 id=\"nested-views-ios-only\">\nNested Views (iOS Only) </h2>\n<p>On iOS, you can nest views within your Text component. Here's an example:</p>\n<div class=\"web-player\"><pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass BlueIsCool extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Text&gt;\n        There is a blue square\n        &lt;View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} /&gt;\n        in between my text.\n      &lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BlueIsCool', () =&gt; BlueIsCool);</pre></div>\n<blockquote><p>In order to use this feature, you must give the view a <code>width</code> and a <code>height</code>.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"containers\">\nContainers </h2>\n<p>The <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> element is special relative to layout: everything inside is no longer using the flexbox layout but using text layout. This means that elements inside of a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> are no longer rectangles, but wrap when they see the end of the line.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Text&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;First part and &lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;second part&lt;/Text&gt;\n&lt;/Text&gt;\n// Text container: all the text flows as if it was one\n// |First part |\n// |and second |\n// |part       |\n\n&lt;View&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;First part and &lt;/Text&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;second part&lt;/Text&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;\n// View container: each text is its own block\n// |First part |\n// |and        |\n// |second part|</pre>\n<h2 id=\"limited-style-inheritance\">\nLimited Style Inheritance </h2>\n<p>On the web, the usual way to set a font family and size for the entire document is to write:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">/* CSS, *not* React Native */\nhtml {\n  font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: 11px;\n  color: #141823;\n}</pre>\n<p>When the browser is trying to render a text node, it's going to go all the way up to the root element of the tree and find an element with a <code>font-size</code> attribute. An unexpected property of this system is that <strong>any</strong> node can have <code>font-size</code> attribute, including a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This was designed for convenience, even though not really semantically correct.</p>\n<p>In React Native, we are more strict about it: <strong>you must wrap all the text nodes inside of a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> component</strong>; you cannot have a text node directly under a <code>&lt;View&gt;</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">// BAD: will raise exception, can't have a text node as child of a &lt;View&gt;\n&lt;View&gt;\n  Some text\n&lt;/View&gt;\n\n// GOOD\n&lt;View&gt;\n  &lt;Text&gt;\n    Some text\n  &lt;/Text&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;</pre>\n<p>You also lose the ability to set up a default font for an entire subtree. The recommended way to use consistent fonts and sizes across your application is to create a component <code>MyAppText</code> that includes them and use this component across your app. You can also use this component to make more specific components like <code>MyAppHeaderText</code> for other kinds of text.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;View&gt;\n  &lt;MyAppText&gt;Text styled with the default font for the entire application&lt;/MyAppText&gt;\n  &lt;MyAppHeaderText&gt;Text styled as a header&lt;/MyAppHeaderText&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;</pre>\n<p>React Native still has the concept of style inheritance, but limited to text subtrees. In this case, the second part will be both bold and red.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}&gt;\n  I am bold\n  &lt;Text style={{color: 'red'}}&gt;\n    and red\n  &lt;/Text&gt;\n&lt;/Text&gt;</pre>\n<p>We believe that this more constrained way to style text will yield better apps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>(Developer) React components are designed with strong isolation in mind: You should be able to drop a component anywhere in your application, trusting that as long as the props are the same, it will look and behave the same way. Text properties that could inherit from outside of the props would break this isolation.</p></li>\n<li><p>(Implementor) The implementation of React Native is also simplified. We do not need to have a <code>fontFamily</code> field on every single element, and we do not need to potentially traverse the tree up to the root every time we display a text node. The style inheritance is only encoded inside of the native Text component and doesn't leak to other components or the system itself.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/Text.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p>\n<h3 id=\"examples\">\nExamples </h3>\n<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr>\n<td><h4 id=\"ios\">\nIOS </h4></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/js/TextExample.ios.js\">Edit on GitHub</a></td>\n</tr></tbody></table>\n<div class=\"example-container\"><pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">'use strict';\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactNative = require('react-native');\nvar {\n  Image,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  View,\n} = ReactNative;\n\nvar Entity = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Text style={{fontWeight: '500', color: '#527fe4'}}&gt;\n        {this.props.children}\n      &lt;/Text&gt;\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nvar AttributeToggler = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function() {\n    return {fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 15};\n  },\n  toggleWeight: function() {\n    this.setState({\n      fontWeight: this.state.fontWeight === 'bold' ?

Works for Android only.</p>\n<p>Possible values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>'auto'</code> - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).</li>\n<li>\n<code>'yes'</code> - The view is important for accessibility.</li>\n<li>\n<code>'no'</code> - The view is not important for accessibility.</li>\n<li>\n<code>'no-hide-descendants'</code> - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"#\">Android <code>importantForAccessibility</code> docs</a> for reference.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"needsoffscreenalphacompositing\">\n<span class=\"platform\">android</span>needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing <span class=\"propType\">PropTypes.bool</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>Whether this <code>View</code> needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (<code>false</code>) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the <code>View</code> you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping <code>View</code>s, or text and a background).</p>\n<p>Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view <strong>contents</strong> are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"rendertohardwaretextureandroid\">\n<span class=\"platform\">android</span>renderToHardwareTextureAndroid <span class=\"propType\">PropTypes.bool</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>Whether this <code>View</code> should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.</p>\n<p>On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed.

Here is a basic example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\"> class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.state = {\n       fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n     };\n   }\n   componentDidMount() {\n     Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n       this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n       {toValue: 1}            // Configuration\n     ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n   }\n   render() {\n     return (\n       &lt;Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n         style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}&gt; // Binds\n         {this.props.children}\n       &lt;/Animated.View&gt;\n     );\n   }\n }</pre>\n<p>Note that only animatable components can be animated. <code>View</code>, <code>Text</code>, and <code>Image</code> are already provided, and you can create custom ones with <code>createAnimatedComponent</code>. These special components do the magic of binding the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame. They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.</p>\n<p>Animations are heavily configurable. Custom and pre-defined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.</p>\n<p>A single <code>Animated.Value</code> can drive any number of properties, and each property can be run through an interpolation first. An interpolation maps input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but also supports easing functions. By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.</p>\n<p>For example, you may want to think about your <code>Animated.Value</code> as going from 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to 1. This can easily be done by modifying <code>style</code> in the example above like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\"> style={{\n   opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n   transform: [{\n     translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n       inputRange: [0, 1],\n       outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n     }),\n   }],\n }}&gt;</pre>\n<p>Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions such as <code>sequence</code> and <code>parallel</code>, and can also be chained together simply by setting the <code>toValue</code> of one animation to be another <code>Animated.Value</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Animated.ValueXY</code> is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are other helpful additions like <code>setOffset</code> and <code>getLayout</code> to aid with typical interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.</p>\n<p>You can see more example usage in <code>AnimationExample.js</code>, the Gratuitous Animation App, and <a href=\"animations\">Animations documentation guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>Animated</code> is designed to be fully serializable so that animations can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system. Checkout <code>Animated.Value.addListener</code> as a way to work around some of these limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance implications in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methods\">\nMethods </h2>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"decay\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>decay<span class=\"methodType\">(value, config)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>Animates a value from an initial velocity to zero based on a decay coefficient.</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"timing\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>timing<span class=\"methodType\">(value, config)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>Animates a value along a timed easing curve.

Props provide configurability for several features, such as auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard types, such as a numeric keypad.</p>\n<p>The simplest use case is to plop down a <code>TextInput</code> and subscribe to the <code>onChangeText</code> events to read the user input. There are also other events, such as <code>onSubmitEditing</code> and <code>onFocus</code> that can be subscribed to. A simple example:</p>\n<div class=\"web-player\"><pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n\nclass UselessTextInput extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;TextInput\n        style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n        onChangeText={(text) =&gt; this.setState({text})}\n        value={this.state.text}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// App registration and rendering\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () =&gt; UselessTextInput);</pre></div>\n<p>Note that some props are only available with <code>multiline={true/false}</code>. Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element (e.g., <code>borderBottomColor</code>, <code>borderLeftWidth</code>, etc.) will not be applied if <code>multiline=false</code>. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your <code>TextInput</code> in a <code>View</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"web-player\"><pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n\nclass UselessTextInput extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;TextInput\n        {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n        editable = {true}\n        maxLength = {40}\n      /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n  // color.\n  render() {\n    return (\n     &lt;View style={{\n       backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n       borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n       borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n     &gt;\n       &lt;UselessTextInput\n         multiline = {true}\n         numberOfLines = {4}\n         onChangeText={(text) =&gt; this.setState({text})}\n         value={this.state.text}\n       /&gt;\n     &lt;/View&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// App registration and rendering\nAppRegistry.registerComponent(\n 'AwesomeProject',\n () =&gt; UselessTextInputMultiline\n);</pre></div>\n<p><code>TextInput</code> has by default a border at the bottom of its view. This border has its padding set by the background image provided by the system, and it cannot be changed. Solutions to avoid this is to either not set height explicitly, case in which the system will take care of displaying the border in the correct position, or to not display the border by setting <code>underlineColorAndroid</code> to transparent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"props\">\nProps </h2>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"view\">\n<a href=\"view#props\">View props...</a> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"autocapitalize\">\nautoCapitalize <span class=\"propType\">PropTypes.oneOf([ 'none', 'sentences', 'words', 'characters', ])</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>Can tell <code>TextInput</code> to automatically capitalize certain characters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>characters</code>: all characters.</li>\n<li>\n<code>words</code>: first letter of each word.</li>\n<li>\n<code>sentences</code>: first letter of each sentence (<em>default</em>).</li>\n<li>\n<code>none</code>: don't auto capitalize anything.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"propTitle\" id=\"autocorrect\">\nautoCorrect <span class=\"propType\">PropTypes.bool</span> </h3>\n<div><p>If <code>false</code>, disables auto-correct.

In particular, this allows JavaScript animations to run smoothly.</p>\n<p>Applications can schedule tasks to run after interactions with the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() =&gt; {\n  // ...long-running synchronous task...\n});</pre>\n<p>Compare this to other scheduling alternatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>requestAnimationFrame(): for code that animates a view over time.</li>\n<li>setImmediate/setTimeout(): run code later, note this may delay animations.</li>\n<li>runAfterInteractions(): run code later, without delaying active animations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The touch handling system considers one or more active touches to be an 'interaction' and will delay <code>runAfterInteractions()</code> callbacks until all touches have ended or been cancelled.</p>\n<p>InteractionManager also allows applications to register animations by creating an interaction 'handle' on animation start, and clearing it upon completion:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">var handle = InteractionManager.createInteractionHandle();\n// run animation... (`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)\n// later, on animation completion:\nInteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);\n// queued tasks run if all handles were cleared</pre>\n<p><code>runAfterInteractions</code> takes either a plain callback function, or a <code>PromiseTask</code> object with a <code>gen</code> method that returns a <code>Promise</code>. If a <code>PromiseTask</code> is supplied, then it is fully resolved (including asynchronous dependencies that also schedule more tasks via <code>runAfterInteractions</code>) before starting on the next task that might have been queued up synchronously earlier.</p>\n<p>By default, queued tasks are executed together in a loop in one <code>setImmediate</code> batch. If <code>setDeadline</code> is called with a positive number, then tasks will only be executed until the deadline (in terms of js event loop run time) approaches, at which point execution will yield via setTimeout, allowing events such as touches to start interactions and block queued tasks from executing, making apps more responsive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methods\">\nMethods </h2>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"runafterinteractions\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>runAfterInteractions<span class=\"methodType\">(task)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>Schedule a function to run after all interactions have completed.

But, ultimately the physical display only have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×960 for iphone 4 or 750×1334 for iphone 6. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look blurry.</p>\n<p>In practice, we found out that developers do not want this feature and they have to work around it by doing manual rounding in order to avoid having blurry elements. In React Native, we are rounding all the pixels automatically.</p>\n<p>We have to be careful when to do this rounding. You never want to work with rounded and unrounded values at the same time as you're going to accumulate rounding errors. Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.</p>\n<p>In React Native, everything in JS and within the layout engine work with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also, rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid accumulating rounding errors.</p>\n<p class=\"edit-page-block\">You can <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/docs/PixelRatio.md\">edit the content above on GitHub</a> and send us a pull request!</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2016 Facebook Inc.<br>Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pixelratio.html\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pixelratio.html</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","systrace":"<h1 id=\"systrace\">\nSystrace </h1>\n<h2 id=\"methods\">\nMethods </h2>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"setenabled\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>setEnabled<span class=\"methodType\">(enabled)</span> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"beginevent\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>beginEvent<span class=\"methodType\">(profileName?, args?)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>beginEvent/endEvent for starting and then ending a profile within the same call stack frame</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"endevent\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>endEvent<span class=\"methodType\">(0)</span> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"beginasyncevent\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>beginAsyncEvent<span class=\"methodType\">(profileName?)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>beginAsyncEvent/endAsyncEvent for starting and then ending a profile where the end can either occur on another thread or out of the current stack frame, eg await the returned cookie variable should be used as input into the endAsyncEvent call to end the profile</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"endasyncevent\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>endAsyncEvent<span class=\"methodType\">(profileName?, cookie?)</span> </h3>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"counterevent\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>counterEvent<span class=\"methodType\">(profileName?, value?)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>counterEvent registers the value to the profileName on the systrace timeline</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"attachtorelayprofiler\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>attachToRelayProfiler<span class=\"methodType\">(relayProfiler)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>Relay profiles use await calls, so likely occur out of current stack frame therefore async variant of profiling is used</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"swizzlejson\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>swizzleJSON<span class=\"methodType\">(0)</span> </h3>\n<div><p>This is not called by default due to perf overhead but it's useful if you want to find traces which spend too much time in JSON.</p></div>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"measuremethods\">\n<span class=\"methodType\">static </span>measureMethods<span class=\"methodType\">(object, objectName, methodNames)</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>Measures multiple methods of a class.

Refering to style objects directly will deprive you of these optimizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">var styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  listItem: {\n    flex: 1,\n    fontSize: 16,\n    color: 'white'\n  },\n  selectedListItem: {\n    color: 'green'\n  }\n});\n\nStyleSheet.flatten([styles.listItem, styles.selectedListItem])\n// returns { flex: 1, fontSize: 16, color: 'green' }</pre>\n<p>Alternative use:</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">StyleSheet.flatten(styles.listItem);\n// return { flex: 1, fontSize: 16, color: 'white' }\n// Simply styles.listItem would return its ID (number)</pre>\n<p>This method internally uses <code>StyleSheetRegistry.getStyleByID(style)</code> to resolve style objects represented by IDs. Thus, an array of style objects (instances of StyleSheet.create), are individually resolved to, their respective objects, merged as one and then returned.

Simply replace the word <code>Responder</code> with <code>PanResponder</code> in each of the typical <code>onResponder*</code> callbacks. For example, the <code>config</code> object would look like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderReject: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderGrant: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderStart: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderEnd: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderRelease: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderMove: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderTerminate: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></li>\n<li>\n<p><code>onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (e, gestureState) =&gt; {...}</code></p>\n<p>In general, for events that have capture equivalents, we update the gestureState once in the capture phase and can use it in the bubble phase as well.</p>\n<p>Be careful with onStartShould* callbacks.

Once the node is the responder, you can rely on every start/end event being processed by the gesture and <code>gestureState</code> being updated accordingly.

The data in the data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly. The clone methods suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows whether to re-render it or not.</p>\n<p>In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by <code>_onDataArrived</code>, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the data source. We use <code>concat</code> to create a new array - mutating <code>this._data</code>, e.g. with <code>this._data.push(newRowData)</code>, would be an error. <code>_rowHasChanged</code> understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare it.</p>\n<pre class=\"prism language-javascript\" data-language=\"javascript\">getInitialState: function() {\n  var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n  return {ds};\n},\n_onDataArrived(newData) {\n  this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n  this.setState({\n    ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n  });\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"methods\">\nMethods </h2>\n<h3 class=\"methodTitle\" id=\"constructor\">\nconstructor<span class=\"methodType\">(params)</span> </h3>\n<div>\n<p>You can provide custom extraction and <code>hasChanged</code> functions for section headers and rows.
